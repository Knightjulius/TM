It	O

It	O

I	O

Please	O
think	O
twice	O
before	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
taking	O
two	O
tablets	O
per	O

(one	O
@	O
breakfast	O

,the	O

@	O

for	O
a	O

when	O
I	O
was	O
alerted	O
to	O
possible	O
long	O
term	O
side	O
effects	O
&	O
then	O
consulted	O
my	O
GP	O
who	O
advised	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
time	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
taking	O
them	O
to	O
only	O
take	O
them	O
on	O
a	O
"need	O

basis".	O


I	O
immediately	O
stopped	O
completely	O
but	O
found	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
muscular	B-Symptom
pains	I-Symptom
all	O
over	O
my	O
body,I	O
have	O
now	O
reduced	O
my	O
intake	O
to	O
one	O
per	O
day	O
@	O
breakfast	O
time	O
&	O
find	O
that	O
this	O
has	O
proved	O
a	O
moderately	O
succesful	O
outcome.	O


Particularly	O
diahrea!	B-ADR
Many	O
unscheduled	O
washroom	O
stops	O
over	O
the	O
time	O
I've	O
taken	O
this	O

Lately	O
ankle	B-ADR
swelling	I-ADR
and	O
lower	B-ADR
tendon	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
that	O
was	O
not	O
experienced	O
previously.	O


Males	O
tend	O
to	O
tolerate	O
this	O
medication	O
better	O
than	O
women	O
from	O
my	O
observation.	O


This	O
medication	O
helped	O
get	O
me	O
back	O
to	O
work	O
and	O
achieve	O
tolerable	O
pain	B-Symptom
levels	O
and	O
mobility.	B-Symptom


I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
for	O
4	O
days	O
and	O
the	O
pain	B-Symptom
returned.	O


Currently	O
take	O
one	O
75mg	O
dose	O
2	O
hours	O
before	O
work	O
and	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
enough	O
to	O
ease	O
my	O
particular	O
condition.	O


Probably	O
alright	O
for	O
otherwise	O
healthy	O
individuals	O
but	O
those	O
with	O
other	O
medical	O
problems	O
should	O
probably	O
avoid	O
it.	O


It	O
will	O
most	O
likely	O
exacerbate	O
there	O
ill	O
health	O
with	O
unwelcome	O
side	O
effects.	O


I	O
was	O
prescribed	O
this	O
drug	O
because	O
I	O
had	O
spent	O
a	O
whole	O
night	O
in	O
complete	O
agony;	B-Symptom
abdominal	B-Symptom
pain,	I-Symptom
lower	B-Symptom
back	I-Symptom
pain,	I-Symptom
all	O
that	O
I	O
imagine	O
labor	B-Symptom
pain	I-Symptom
to	O
be,	O
except	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
in	O
labor.	O


Though	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
my	O
pain	B-Symptom
remains	O
undetermined,	O
the	O
Arthrotec	B-Drug
combined	O
with	O
Paracetamol	B-Drug
pretty	O
much	O
eliminated	O
the	O
pain.	B-Symptom


This	O
was	O
a	O
big	O
relief,	O
as	O
the	O
1200	O
MG	O
of	O
Ibuprofen	B-Drug
I	O
had	O
taken	O
throughout	O
the	O
night	O
had	O
done	O
nothing.	O


I	O
only	O
took	O
1	O
Arthrotec	B-Drug
and	O
1	O
Paracetamol	B-Drug
and	O
that	O
did	O
the	O
trick.	O


HOWEVER:	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
very	O
bad	O
headache	B-ADR
yesterday	O
and	O
Ibuprofen	B-Drug
again	O
didn't	O
work.	O


I	O
still	O
had	O
the	O
other	O
Arthrotec	B-Drug
pills	O
left,	O
so	O
I	O
took	O
one.	O


Although	O
it	O
alleviated	O
the	O
pain,	B-Symptom
I	O
got	O
up	O
this	O
morning	O
with	O
heavy	B-ADR
vaginal	I-ADR
bleeding	I-ADR
even	O
though	O
my	O
period	O
ended	O
last	O
week.	O


I	O
was	O
relieved	O
to	O
read	O
that	O
this	O
could	O
be	O
a	O
side	O
effect,	O
as	O
it	O
means	O
I	O
probably	O
don't	O
have	O
something	O
serious,	O
but	O
I	O
will	O
have	O
to	O
be	O
in	O
some	O
serious	B-Symptom

to	O
risk	O

again.	O


Next	O

I'll	O
try	O
my	O

otherwise	O
why	O

yes	O
there	O
was	O
some	O
improvement	O
with	O
the	O

is	O
not	O
worth	O
to	O
continue.	O


After	O
taking	O
the	O
drug	O
for	O
7	O

i've	O
suddenly	O
developped	O

I've	O
had	O
these	O

for	O
4	O

and	O
i've	O
just	O
realised	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
side	O
effects	O
from	O
arthotec.	B-Drug


The	O
problem	O
is	O
if	O
i	O

I	O

Seeing	O
the	O

After	O

with	O

I	O
finally	O
discovered	O
arthrotec	B-Drug
which	O
relieved	O
the	O

and	O
no	O
side	O

I	O
usually	O

I	O

I	O

I	O
would	O

I	O

I	O
was	O

at	O
the	O

I	O

think	O

underestimated	O
how	O
severe	O
it	O
would	O

Arthrotec	B-Drug
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
ease	O
my	O

not	O

Have	O
stopped	O

immediatedly	O

eased	O
and	O

Have	O
reverted	O
to	O

I	O
have	O

for	O
a	O

a	O
half	O
and	O
have	O
been	O
very	O

that	O
it	O

with	O
my	O
back	B-Symptom

However.	O


over	O
the	O
last	O
six	O
months,	O
I	O
have	O
started	O
having	O
vaginal	B-ADR
bleeding	I-ADR
almost	O
every	O
day	O
of	O
the	O
month.	O


Lots	O
of	O
clotting,	B-ADR
and	I-ADR
horrible	I-ADR
periods.	I-ADR


I	O
went	O
to	O
the	O

everything	O
came	O
out	O
normal.	O


The	O
doc	O
put	O
me	O
on	O

But,	O
the	O
bleeding	B-ADR
has	I-ADR
not	I-ADR
subsided.	I-ADR


So	O
now	O
I	O
am	O
scheduled	O
to	O
have	O
an	O
endometrial	O

I	O
had	O
an	O
ephiphany	O
last	O

about	O
Arthrotec	B-Drug
and	O
began	O
researching	O
the	O
side	O
effect.	O


When	O
I	O
came	O
across	O
this	O
website,	O
I	O
was	O
appalled	O
that	O
the	O
majority	O
of	O
the	O
females	O
mention	O
heavy/extra	B-ADR
vaginal	I-ADR
bleeding.	I-ADR


I	O
firmly	O
believe	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
answer	O
to	O
my	O
bleeding	B-ADR
problem	I-ADR
and	O
will	O
be	O
telling	O
the	O
doctor	O
on	O
Monday,.	O


Although	O
this	O
drug	O
has	O
helped	O
with	O
the	O
pain,	B-Symptom
it	O
is	O
not	O
worth	O
the	O
cost	O
and	O
hassle	O
of	O
bleeding	B-ADR
constantly.,	I-ADR
On	O
top	O
of	O
that,	O
I	O

a	O

that	O
a	O
31	O
year	O

should	O
not	O

to	O

I	O
truly	O

that	O
there	O
are	O
no	O
long	O

from	O
this.	O


I	O

it.	O


Dizziness,	B-ADR

feel	B-ADR
like	I-ADR
a	I-ADR
bubble	I-ADR
of	I-ADR
air	I-ADR
is	I-ADR
stuck	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

Hadn't	O
realised	O
it	O
was	O
related	O
until	O
I	O
read	O
this	O
but	O
I	O
get	O
the	O
hunger	B-ADR
pangs	I-ADR
too,	O
I'm	O
assuming	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
acids	O

gas	O
in	O
your	O
stomach	O
constantly	O
churning	O
over	O
that	O
make	O
you	O
feel	O
like	O
you're	O
hungry.	O


I've	O
taken	O
co-codamol	B-Drug
for	O
my	O
fibromyalgia	B-Disease
for	O
many	O
years	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
very	O
few	O
side	O
effects	O
with.	O


I've	O
recently	O
had	O
this	O
severe	B-Symptom
hip	I-Symptom
pain	I-Symptom
on	O
both	O
sides	O
which	O
the	O
co	B-Drug
codamol	I-Drug
wasn't	O
touching	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
back	O
to	O
the	O
Dr	O
He	O
recommended	O
this	O
anti-inflamatory	O
and	O
as	O
he	O
said	O
next	O
stop	O
would	O
be	O
cortozone	B-Drug
injections	I-Drug
I	O
was	O
willing	O
to	O
give	O
it	O
a	O
try.	O


I've	O
tried	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
week	O
but	O
it	O
makes	O
me	O
feel	B-ADR
dreadful.	I-ADR


Every	O
time	O
I	O
stand	O
up	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
hold	O
onto	O
something	O
for	O
fear	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
falling	I-ADR
over,	I-ADR
I	O
feel	O
sick	B-ADR
and	O
light	B-ADR
headed	I-ADR
and	O
I	O
get	O
those	O
waves	O
of	O
nausea	B-ADR
where	O
you	O
suddenly	O
feel	B-ADR
all	I-ADR
clammy.	I-ADR


It's	O
very	O
much	O
like	O
having	O
a	O
permanent	B-ADR
hangover,	I-ADR
even	O
down	O
to	O
the	O
hunger	B-ADR
which	O
until	O
I	O
read	O
thsi	O
site	O
I	O
hadn't	O
connected	O
to	O
the	O
rest	O
of	O
it.	O


I've	O
felt	O
no	O
discernible	O
difference	O
in	O
the	O
pain	B-Symptom
in	I-Symptom
my	I-Symptom
hips	I-Symptom
and	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
simply	O
aren't	O
worth	O
it	O
so	O
thats	O
it	O
for	O
me	O
and	O
this	O
drug.	O


Stomach	B-ADR
pains,	I-ADR
chest	B-ADR
pains,	I-ADR
anxiety,	B-ADR
fatigue,	B-ADR
headache,	B-ADR
erratic	B-ADR
heart	I-ADR
beat,	I-ADR
raised	B-ADR
blood	I-ADR
pressure,	I-ADR
dizziness,	B-ADR
nausea	B-ADR
(even	O
when	O
taken	O
with	O
food),	O
blurred	B-ADR
vision.	I-ADR


I	O
was	O
given	O
a	O
6	O
day	O
trial	O
of	O
Arthrotec	B-Drug
along	O
with	O
a	O
9	O
day	O
trial	O
of	O
Aciphex	B-Drug
on	O
4/25	O
(three	O
bottles	O
of	O
three	O
pills).	O


This	O
was	O
a	O
solution	O
my	O
doctor	O
came	O
up	O
with.	O


I've	O
never	O
had	O
consistant	O
heart	B-Finding
burn	I-Finding
or	O
indigestion,	B-Finding
no	O
signs	O
of	O
acid	B-Finding
reflux,	I-Finding
so	O
I	O
was	O
confused	O
as	O
to	O
why	O
he	O
would	O
offer	O
me	O
this	O
medication.	O


The	O
first	O
day	O
I	O
took	O
both	O
pills,	O
I	O
experienced	O
some	O
dizziness	B-ADR
and	O
some	O
nausea	B-ADR
and	O
some	O
serious	O
period	B-ADR
like	I-ADR
cramps.	I-ADR


I	O
was	O
at	O
work,	O
so	O
I	O
just	O
had	O
to	O
brush	O
it	O
off.	O


It	O
continued	O
each	O
time	O
I	O
took	O
it.	O


After	O
about	O
two	O
days	O
(two	O
doses),	O
the	O
cramps	B-ADR
continued	O
and	O
began	O
inhibiting	B-ADR
my	I-ADR
menstrual	I-ADR
cycle	I-ADR
(which	O
I	O
was	O
due	O
to	O
start).	O


So,	O
I	O
googled	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
of	O
the	O
drug,	O
came	O
across	O
this	O
site,	O
and	O
realized	O
I	O
wasn't	O
the	O
only	O
one	O
with	O
those	O
side	O
effects,	O
so	O
I	O
felt	O
a	O
little	O
better	O
about	O
it.	O


On	O
the	O
evening	O
of	O
4/30,	O
I	O
suddenly	O
got	O
some	O
serious	O
chest	B-ADR
pains,	I-ADR
an	O
elevated	B-ADR
heart	I-ADR
rate	I-ADR
(I	O
was	O
laying	O
down	O
with	O
my	O
husband	O
and	O
this	O
was	O
similar	O
to	O
an	O
"I	O
just	O
finished	O
running!"	O
heart	O
rate),	O
hot	B-ADR
flashes,	I-ADR
dizziness,	B-ADR
sever	B-ADR
stomach	I-ADR
cramps,	I-ADR
and	O
weakness	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
legs.	I-ADR


I	O
literally	O
thought	B-ADR
I	I-ADR
was	I-ADR
dying.	I-ADR


It	O
passed	O
within	O
45	O
minutes	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
work	O
the	O
next	O
day.	O


At	O
work	O
(5/1),	O
I	O
was	O
sitting	O
at	O
my	O
desk	O
and	O
the	O
same	O
thing	O
happened.	O


I	O
stepped	O
out	O
to	O
get	O
some	O
air	O
but	O
it	O
didn't	O
work.	O


A	O
friend	O
at	O
work	O
had	O
to	O
call	O
an	O
ambulance.	O


I	O
was	O
filled	O
in	O
by	O
the	O
ER	O
doc	O
that	O
the	O
mixture	O
of	O
Aciphex	B-Drug
and	O
Arthrotec	B-Drug
was	O
insane	O
and	O
that	O
he	O
was	O
trying	O
to	O
keep	O
from	O
cracking	O
up	O
at	O
my	O
primary	O
doc's	O
decision	O
to	O
combine	O
them.	O


Random	O
severe	B-ADR
cramping,	I-ADR
diarrhea,	B-ADR
increased	B-ADR
menstrual	I-ADR
blood	I-ADR
flow.	I-ADR


The	O
day	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
first	O
Arthrotec,	B-Drug
I	O
started	O
experiencing	O
urinary	B-ADR
incontinence.	I-ADR


It's	O
not	O
severe	O
but	O
enough	O
to	O
be	O
disruptive	O
and	O
require	O
a	O
pad.	O


I	O
haven't	O
seen	O
this	O
listed	O
in	O
anyone's	O
symptomology.	O


Has	O
anyone	O
else	O
had	O
this	O
experience?.	O


This	O
medicine	O
helped	O
with	O
the	O
heel	B-Disease
spurs,	I-Disease
however	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
were	O
far	O
worse	O
and	O
not	O
worth	O
taking	O
the	O
medicine.	O


I	O
had	O
bad	B-ADR
gas	I-ADR
and	O
SEVERE	B-ADR
diarrhea	I-ADR
along	O
with	O
stomach	B-ADR
cramps	I-ADR
and	O
nausea.	B-ADR


Has	O
been	O
all	O
OK	O
until	O
recently	O
when	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
get	O
"	O
fluey"	I-ADR

in	I-ADR
upper	I-ADR

legs	I-ADR
etc	O
As	O
I	O
had	O
just	O
recently	O
had	O

thought	O
this	O
was	O
the	O
cause.	O


However	O
the	O

persisted,	O
GP	O
said	O
"	O
just	O

-	O
but	O
after	O
4	O
weeks!	O
Noticed	O
today	O
after	O
leaving	O
Artrotec	B-Drug
off	O
for	O
a	O
day	O
or	O
so	O
,that	O
things	O
were	O
much	O
better	O
until	O
I	O
took	O
one	O

fluey	B-ADR

returned	O
within	O

Naseua,	B-ADR

dry	B-ADR

loss	B-ADR
of	I-ADR

after	O
taking	O
just	O
one	O

had	O
hunger	B-ADR
feeling	I-ADR
and	O
stomach	B-ADR

in	O
the	O

and	O
through	O
the	O

in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

I	O
just	O
went	O
for	O
test	O
and	O
haven't	O
gotten	O
results	O
yet,	O
but	O
Dr	O
feels	O
I	O
have	O
more	O
than	O
1	O
form	O
of	O
arthritis,	B-Disease
I	O
also	O
have	O
a	O
very	O
sensitive	O
stomach,	O
this	O
is	O
cheaper	O
and	O
more	O
approved	O
by	O

so	O
that	O
is	O
why	O
this	O

Seems	O
to	O
me	O
we	O
always	O
have	O
to	O
choose	O
lesser	O
of	O
the	O
2	O
evils,	O
I	O
can't	O
deal	O
with	O
Charlie	B-Symptom
Horses,	I-Symptom
so	O
I	O
am	O
stopping	O
this	O
med.	O


I	O
cannot	O
believe	O
the	O
immediate	O
difference	O
this	O
medication	O
had	O
made	O
in	O
my	O
life.	O


I	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
up	O
from	O
my	O
desk	O
without	O
holding	O
onto	O
the	O
desk	O
and	O
walking	B-Symptom
up	I-Symptom
the	I-Symptom

was	I-Symptom
intolerable.	I-Symptom


Within	O
one	O
day	O
I	O
felt	O
the	O

lessen.	O


I	O
am	O
now	O
walking	O
up	O
the	O
stairs	O
95	O

can	O

through	O
a	O

down	O
every	O
5	O

i	O
am	O
in	O
need	O
of	O
a	O
knee	O
replacement,	O
but	O
in	O
meantime	O
feel	O
like	O
I	O
have	O
my	O
life	O
back.	O


Took	O
one	O
pill	O
and	O
20	O
minutes	O
later	O
had	O
intense	B-ADR
pelvic	I-ADR
and	O
back	B-ADR
pain.	B-ADR


Felt	O
like	O
a	O
miscarriage	B-Finding
(I've	O
had	O
3	O

them).	B-Finding


This	O
intense,	B-ADR
horrid	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
lasted	O
1.5	O
hours.	O


Then	O
I	O
had	O
spotting.	B-ADR


And	O
terrible	B-ADR
bloating	I-ADR
and	O
nausea.	B-ADR


No	O

I	O
tried	O
the	O
advertised	O

medicines	O
with	O
severe	O
side-effects	O
and	O
only	O
tried	O
this	O
one	O
because	O
the	O

had	O

Instead	O
of	O
taking	O
the	O
pill	O
2X	O
daily,	O
as	O
prescribed	O
I	O
take	O
it	O
at	O

once	O

usually	O
about	O
3-4	O

skipping	O
a	O

two	O
at	O
a	O

My	O

has	O
been	O
under	O

At	O

Why	O

about	O

I've	O

once	O

rather	O
than	O
twice,	O
which	O
is	O
just	O
enough	O
to	O
manage	O
my	O
pain	B-Symptom
levels.	O


I	O
feel	O
it	O
has	O
a	O
cummulative	O
effect.	O


maybe.	O


I	O
dont	O
think	O
anything	O
will	O
completely	O
remove	O
the	O
pain,	B-Symptom
and	O
maybe	O
shouldnt	O
since	O
it	O
helps	O
you	O
to	O
know	O
whats	O
going	O
on.	O


Else	O
how	O
much	O
would	O
you	O
have	O

thus	O
increasing	O
your	O

No	O

some	O

I	O
will	O
not	O
take	O
it	O
again	O
as	O
the	O

should	O

with	O

Terrible	O

I	O

my	O

a	O
few	O
days	O

my	O

I	O
went	O

my	O

the	O

my	O

there	O
was	O
something	O

I	O

so	O
my	O
that	O
is	O
why	O
the	O

I	O
was	O

to	O
stop	O

Arthrotec	B-Drug
and	O
am	O
now	O
using	O
a	O
natural	O

that	O

it	O
is	O
called	O
Pernamax.	B-Drug


For	O
the	O

I	O
took	O
one	O
pill	O
at	O

but	O
then	O
switched	O
to	O
mornings	O
with	O
breakfast.	O


I	O
experienced	O
extreme	B-ADR
uterine	I-ADR
cramping	I-ADR
within	O
30	O
minutes	O
of	O
taking	O
in	O
the	O
morning;	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
excruciating	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
for	O
an	O
hour	O
so	O
I	O
called	O
an	O
ambulance	O
and	O
was	O
rushed	O
to	O
the	O
emergency	O
room.	O


Heavy	B-ADR
bleeding	I-ADR
started	O
within	O
30	O
minutes	O
after	O
the	O
cramping	B-ADR
ceased.	O


Medical	O
personnel	O
dismissed	O
the	O
symptoms	O
as	O
not	O
being	O
related	O
to	O
taking	O
this	O
drug,	O
but	O
once	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking,	O
my	O
cramping	B-ADR
and	O
bleeding	B-ADR
stopped.	O


Subsequent	O
uterine	O
&	O
vaginal	O
ultrasounds	O
did	O
not	O
show	O
anything	O
else	O
to	O
be	O
the	O

My	O
OB/Gyn	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
she	O
uses	O
misoprostal	B-Drug
(1	O
of	O
the	O
drugs	O
in	O
Arthrotec)	B-Drug
for	O
miscarriages	O
&	O
advised	O
me	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
the	O
drug.	O


I	O
would	O
not	O
recommend	O
to	O
females.	O


If	O
you	O
do	O
take	O
this	O
drug,	O
please	O
pay	O
careful	O
attention	O
to	O
your	O
body	O
and	O
other	O
symptoms	O
that	O
may	O
appear.	O


Read	O
all	O
drug	O
material	O
carefully.	O


The	O
symptoms	O
got	O
progressively	O
worse	O
with	O
time.	O


They	O
included	O
fluid	B-ADR
retention,	I-ADR
all	O
over	O
muscle	B-ADR
pain,	I-ADR
cramps.	B-ADR


I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
them	O
a	O
week	O

and	O
felt	O
much	O
better	O
the	O
next	O
day.	O


Some	O
of	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
haven't	O
totally	O
disappeared	O
but	O
I'm	O
improving	O
with	O
each	O
day.	O


My	O
doctor	O
doesn't	O
believe	O
that	O
this	O
medication	O
could	O
cause	O
this	O
reaction.	O


HAVE	O
BEEN	O
TAKING	O
1	O
75	O
ARTHROTEC	B-Drug
DAILY	O
IT	O
HAS	O
ALMOST	O
TOTALY	O
ELIMINATED	O
MY	O
KNEE	B-Symptom
PAIN	I-Symptom
I	O
HAD	O
ALMOST	O
RESIGNED	O
MYSELF	O
TO	O
A	O
KNEE	O
REPLACEMENT.	O


If	O
I	O
take	O
the	O
pill	O
on	O
an	O
empty	O
stomach	O
I	O
get	O
a	O
very	O
faint	O
sensation	O
of	O
queasiness	B-ADR
.	O


almost	O
to	O
faint	O
to	O
notice.	O


However,	O
I	O
also	O
get	O
diarrhoea	B-ADR
at	O
least	O
twice	O
a	O
day.	O


There	O
are	O
no	O
gas	B-ADR
pains	I-ADR
and	O
no	O
other	O
symptoms,	O
so	O
it's	O
inconvenient	O
more	O
than	O
anything	O
else.	O


When	O
I	O
am	O
on	O
holiday	O
at	O
the	O
coast	O
I	O
am	O
pain	B-Symptom
free,	O
mostly,	O
so	O
don't	O
take	O
any	O
Arthrotec,	B-Drug
but	O
when	O
I	O
get	O
back	O
to	O
a	O
drier	O
climate	O
the	O
pain	B-Symptom
is	I-Symptom
severe,	I-Symptom
so	O
Arthrotec	B-Drug
is	O
very	O
important	O
to	O
me	O
and	O
my	O
quality	O
of	O
life.	O


It	O
also	O
allows	O
me	O
to	O
sleep.	O


Didn't	O
work.	O


Once	O
I	O
had	O
bad	O
nausea	B-ADR
due	O
to	O
taking	O
it	O
on	O
an	O
empty	O
stomach.	O


Also	O
causes	O
bleeding	B-ADR
problems.	I-ADR


Stops	O
migraine	B-Disease
immediately	O
when	O
taken	O
early	O
on	O
when	O
all	O
others	O
didn't.	O


If	O
I	O
wait	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
take	O
two	O
doses.	O


Easy	O
to	O
take	O
-	O
a	O
powder	O
in	O
a	O
small	O
amount	O
of	O
water.	O


It	O
is	O
an	O
anti-inflammatory,	O
not	O
a	O
hypnotic.	O


My	O
insurance	O
only	O
pays	O
for	O
4	O
doses	O
a	O
month,	O
less	O
than	O
I	O
need,	O
and	O
paying	O
for	O
it	O
without	O
insurance	O
is	O
too	O
expensive.	O


Tastes	O
gross	O
--	O
heavy	O
mint	O

Felt	O
like	O
it	O
was	O
burning	B-ADR
my	I-ADR

all	O
the	O
way	O
down,	O
then	O
dry	B-ADR
heaves	I-ADR
once	O
it	O
hit	O
my	O

But	O
it	O
didn't	O
make	O
me	O
actually	O
vomit,	B-Finding
and	O
the	O
burning	B-ADR
sensation	I-ADR
went	O
away	O
quickly.	O


Was	O
prescribed	O
Cambia	B-Drug
as	O
a	O
backup	O
to	O
Maxalt,	B-Drug
since	O
triptans	B-Drug
can	O
be	O
taken	O
only	O
2	O
days/week.	O


Unfortunately,	O
it	O
didn't	O
work	O
at	O
all	O
on	O
my	O
migraines,	B-Disease
so	O
I'll	O
continue	O
to	O
look	O
for	O
something	O
else	O
as	O
a	O
backup.	O


Because	O
of	O
aspartame	O

I	O
experienced	O

If	O
aspartame	O
is	O
a	O
trigger	O
for	O
your	O

do	O

this.	O


Most	O

a	O

an	O

that	O
works	O
better	O
than	O
any	O

I	O
was	O

that	O
this	O
drug	O
noticeably	O
lowers	O
my	O
pain	B-Symptom
level	O
after	O
about	O

I	O
still	O
have	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
in	O
combo	O
with	O
a	O
stronger	O
pain	B-Symptom

but	O
it's	O
just	O
a	O
good	O
drug	O
for	O
aches	B-Symptom

Better	O

taken	O
that	O
gave	O

discernable	O
relief	O
within	O
90	O
minutes	O
of	O
taking	O
it.	O


Gastrointestinal	B-ADR
problems	I-ADR
were	O
due	O
largely	O
to	O
my	O
taking	O
the	O
drug	O
too	O
close	O

or	O
after	O
having	O

Absolutely	O
none!.	O


I	O
was	O
originally	O
taking	O
150mg	O
per	O
day,	O
but	O
cut	O
it	O
to	O
100mg	O
because	O
the	O
lesser	O
dose	O
seemed	O
to	O
work	O
as	O
well.	O


My	O
internist	O
had	O
urged	O
me	O
to	O
take	O
Vioxx,	B-Drug
Celebrx	B-Drug
and	O
Bextra	B-Drug
(at	O

times,	O

the	O

My	O

since	O
my	O

is	O

that	O
is	O
not	O
considered	O
a	O
health	O

was	O

this	O
to	O
replace	O
ibuprofen	B-Drug
(possible	O
sun	B-ADR

but	O
it	O
doesn't	O

None,	O
unless	O
too	O

then	O
it	O
can	O
cause	O
gassy	B-ADR

It	O
is	O
the	O
BEST	O
pain	B-Symptom

I	O
have	O
ever	O
been	O

and	O
I	O
will	O

it!	O
I	O
happen	O

Endometriosis	B-Disease
that	O
has	O
attached	O
to	O
"everything"	O
in	O
the	O

including	O
my	O
Sciatic	O

Sciatic	B-Disease
Endo	I-Disease
is	O
rarely	O
seen,	O
but	O
they	O
found	O
it	O
in	O
me.	O


I	O
do	O
Restorative	O

to	O

up	O
every	O

keep	O
the	O
Cataflam	B-Drug
handy	O
as	O
nothing	O
works	O
better	O
for	O
the	O
pain,	B-Symptom
unless	O
I	O

I	O
have	O

a	O
Demerol	B-Drug

it	O
(rarely).	O


However,	O
I	O
have	O
noticed	O
in	O
the	O
"patient	O

they	O

that	O

are	O

were	O
not	O

I	O
started	O
this	O

The	O
best	O
dose	O
for	O
me	O
(per	O
my	O

is	O
2	O

to	O

My	O

prescribed	O
this	O

(instead	O

to	O
be	O
taken	O
twice	O
daily,	O

after	O

the	O
side	O

I	O

concerned	O
about	O
that	O

I'll	O

it	O

made	O
an	O
error	O
in	O
only	O
giving	O
me	O
6	O
tablets	O
instead	O
of	O
60.	O


I'm	O
glad	O
it	O
happened;	O
it	O
saved	O

Started	O
experiencing	O
pain	B-Symptom
in	I-Symptom
my	I-Symptom
right	I-Symptom
heel	I-Symptom
when	O
walking	O
in	O
mid-November;	O
it	O
got	O
worse	O
over	O
time	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
see	O
my	O
orthopedist	O
in	O
early	O
December	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
I	O
had	O
plantar	B-Disease
fasciitis;	I-Disease
he	O
showed	O
me	O
stretching	O
exercises	O
and	O
advised	O
me	O
to	O
get	O
inserts	O
for	O
my	O
walking	O
shoes,	O
wear	O
cushioned	O
house	O
slippers	O
and	O
avoid	O
walking	O
up	O
inclines.	O


The	O
pain	B-Symptom
lessened	O
by	O
following	O
all	O
these	O
recommendations	O
but	O
I	O
was	O
still	O
uncomfortable	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
the	O
time.	O


I	O
finally	O
went	O
to	O
see	O
the	O
orthopedist	O
in	O
March	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
my	O
foot	O
"can"	O
improve	O
if	O
I	O
continued	O
with	O
the	O
exercises,	O
etc	O
At	O
the	O
very	O
end,	O
he	O
asked	O
if	O
he	O
had	O
given	O
me	O
the	O
"patch"	O
at	O
my	O
first	O
appointment;	O
so	O
I	O
left	O
with	O
a	O
sample	O
and	O
a	O
prescription	O
for	O
the	O
Flector	B-Drug
patch.	I-Drug


I	O
cut	O
a	O
patch	O
(there	O
are	O
five	O
in	O
each	O
reclosable	O
pouch)	O
in	O
half	O
and	O
it	O
covers	O
the	O
heel	O
area.	O


After	O
I	O
used	O
it	O
the	O
first	O
time,	O
the	O
puffiness	B-Symptom
and	O
pain	B-Symptom
were	O
gone!	O
I	O
found	O
it	O
best	O
to	O
use	O
the	O
patch	O
at	O
night	O
only	O
although	O
you	O
can	O
replace	O
it	O
every	O
12	O
hours.	O


I	O
put	O
the	O
patch	O
on	O
at	O
bedtime,	O
tape	O
the	O
edges	O
down	O
and	O
wear	O
a	O
sock	O
to	O
secure	O
it.	O


Initially,	O
I	O
used	O
it	O
every	O
night	O
and	O
after	O
about	O
three	O
weeks,	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
cut	O
down	O
to	O
several	O
times	O
a	O

It	O
certainly	O
helped	O

comfortable.	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
see	O
my	O
doctor	O
and	O
told	O
him	O
about	O
my	O
discovery.	O


First	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
bit	O
reluctant	O
but	O
in	O
the	O
following	O
meeting	O
he	O
already	O
told	O
me	O
that	O
he	O
had	O
read	O
about	O
Lipitor's	B-Drug
psychiatric	B-Finding
side	O
effects.	O


He	O
therefore	O
put	O
me	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
completely	O
and	O
suggested	O
a	O
much	O
lower	O
dosage	O
of	O
10mg	O
Crestor.	B-Drug


In	O
addition,	O
he	O
prescribed	O
a	O
new	O
medication:	O
Niacin,	B-Drug
beginning	O
with	O
500mg	O
the	O
first	O
month	O
and	O
then	O
increasing	O
to	O
1,000	O
in	O
the	O
second	O
(with	O
the	O
ultimate	O
aim	O
of	O
reaching	O
2,000	O
in	O
the	O
fourth	O
monthly).	O


Bottom	O
line:	O
When	O
I	O
discontinued	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
two	O
months	O
ago	O
my	O
LDL	O
reached	O
165.	O


This	O
week	O
my	O
blood	O
test	O
indicated	O
an	O
LDL	O
level	O

124.	O


So,	O
after	O
being	O
helped	O
by	O
folks	O
on	O
this	O

I	O
hope	O
I	O
can	O
be	O
of	O
some	O
help	O
to	O
others	O
who	O
suffer	O
from	O
statin	O
side	O
effects.	O


Therefore,	O
here	O
is	O
what	O
I've	O
done	O
during	O
the	O
past	O
two	O
months:	O
-	O
Took	O
500mg	O
of	O
Niacin	B-Drug
during	O
the	O
first	O
months	O
and	O
1,000mg	O
during	O
the	O
second;	O
-	O
Took	O
a	O
total	O
of	O
10	O
Crestor	B-Drug
pills	O
(10mg	O
which	O
are	O
equivalent	O
to	O
20mg	O
of	O
Lipitor)	B-Drug
per	O
month,	O
i.e.,	O
one	O
every	O
three	O

of	O
Phytosterol.	B-Drug


-	O
A	O
cup	O
of	O

made	O

Now,	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
reach	O
the	O
maximum	O
intake	O
of	O
Niacin	B-Drug
in	O
two	O
months	O
(2,000mg)	O
the	O
LDL	O
will	O
drop	O
from	O
124	O
to	O

in	O
my	O

during	O

was	O

couldn't	O
figure	O
out	O
why	O
these	O

made	O
me	O
think	O
i	O
needed	O
antidepressants	O
or	O
something	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
constant	O
anxiety/fear	B-ADR
(which	O
i	O
have	O
taken	O

are	O

have	O
noticed	O
slightly	O

so	O
I	O

this	O

it	O
did	O

started	O
experiencing	O
the	O
muscle	B-ADR
tingley	I-ADR
thing	I-ADR
and	O
stopped	O
,	O
then	O
started	O
with	O
the	O
Atorvastatin,	B-Drug
where	O
i	O
noticed	O
the	O
above	O

The	O
week	O
I	O
started	O
to	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
chest	B-ADR
ache,	I-ADR
confirmed	O
to	O
be	O
muscular	O
by	O
doctors.	O


At	O
the	O
start	O
of	O
the	O
second	O
week,	O
I	O
accidentally	O
took	O
a	O
dose	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
instead	O
of	O
the	O
night	O
because	O
I	O
took	O
the	O
wrong	O
pill	O
(skipped	O
the	O
night	O
dose).	O


The	O
day	O
after	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
have	O
the	O

The	O
worst	O
one	O
-	O
the	O
mouth	O
one	O
has	O
faded,	O
but	O
the	O
others	O
remain.	O


I	O
found	O
out	O
too	O
late	O
grapefruit	O
juice	O
can	O
make	O
this	O
drug	O
stronger.	O


I	O
drank	O
it	O
some	O
days	O
during	O
the	O
first	O
2	O

Stopped	O
drinking	O
it.	O


At	O
the	O
beginning	O
of	O
third	O
week	O
I	O
took	O
50mg	O
of	O
CoQ10	B-Drug
per	O
day	O
for	O
3	O
days.	O


I	O
couldn't	O
sense	O
an	O
improvement,	O
but	O
after	O
stopping	O
for	O
other	O
three	O
days	O
I	O
will	O
try	O
again.	O


(I	O
need	O
better	O
evidence	O
before	O
buying	O
a	O
can	O
of	O
CoQ10,	B-Drug
it	O
is	O
very	O

and	O
hard	O
to	O
find	O
around	O
here).	O


Will	O
beg	O
my	O
cardiologist	O
to	O
let	O
me	O
try	O
natural	O
exercise	O
before	O
continuing	O
statins.	O


Giving	O
it	O
a	O

it	O
was	O

all	O

I	O
have	O
to	O

I	O

Since	O

it	O

My	O
total	O

taking	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


The	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
(along	O
with	O
healthy	O
eating)	O
has	O
brought	O
that	O
number	O
down	O
to	O
165,	O
so	O
I	O
am	O
very	O
happy.	O


I	O
have	O
had	O
none	O
of	O
the	O
side	O

I	O

the	O

beyond	O
a	O
relatively	O
short	O

The	O
question	O
is.	O


is	O
lipitor	B-Drug
causing	O
this?	O
I	O
am	O
taking	O
20	O
mg	O
a	O
day	O
and	O
have	O
been	O
taking	O
this	O
for	O
6	O
years.	O


This	O
has	O
been	O
a	O
huge	O
problem	O
for	O
the	O
last	O
2.5	O
years.	O


I	O
read	O
this	O

and	O
feel	O
that	O
lipitor	B-Drug
is	O
causing	O
my	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
to	O
numberous	O
orthopods,	O
rheumetoligists,	O
neouroligist,	O
and	O
others	O
who	O
cannot	O
find	O
any	O
problems.	O


So,	O
when	O
I	O
read	O
about	O
all	O
these	O
people	O
who	O
seem	O
to	O
have	O
figured	O
this	O
out	O
.	O


I	O
have	O
hope.	O


But	O
are	O
they	O
correct	O
in	O
thier	O
assumptions?	O
We	O
are	O
all	O
desperate	O
to	O
find	O
an	O
answer	O
(the	O
cause)	O
and	O
ultimately	O
a	O
cure.	O


But	O
is	O
lipitor	B-Drug
the	O
answer?	O
That	O
is	O

1	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
my	O

my	O

was	O
dry.	O


Had	O
4	O

over	O

My	O

were	O

I	O
was	O

some	O

and	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


All	O
the	O
symptoms	O
largely	O
disappeared	O
after	O
two	O
days	O
off	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


Took	O
months	O
for	O
lingering	O
effects	O
to	O
clear	O
completely.	O


Anyone	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
showing	O
any	O
undiagnosed	O
symptoms,	O
should	O
be	O
taken	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
awhile	O
as	O
a	O
test.	O


After	O
about	O
4	O
years	O
of	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
I	O
started	O
experiencing	O
severe	B-ADR
leg	I-ADR
cramping	I-ADR
at	O
night	O
with	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
traveling	O
to	O
my	O
buddocks	O
and	O
stomach	O
as	O
well.	O


The	O
pain	B-ADR
was	O
so	O
bad	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
bed	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
crawl	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
bathroom	O
to	O
take	O
Advil	B-Drug
for	O
the	O
pain.	B-ADR


I	O
asked	O
my	O
doctor	O
what	O
could	O
have	O
caused	O
this	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
probably	O
from	O
the	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


Recently	O
I	O
experienced	O
extreme	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
that	O
stretched	O
to	O
my	O
side	O
and	O
back.	O


The	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
came	O
suddenly	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
come	O
and	O
go	O
for	O
a	O
week	O
before	O
it	O
became	O
so	O
bad	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
sleep.	O


I	O
had	O
just	O
gotten	O
over	O
a	O
urinery	B-Disease
tract	I-Disease
infection	I-Disease
and	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
had	O
returned	O
but	O
the	O
symptoms	O
were	O
different.	O


I	O
still	O
had	O
the	O
urge	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
urinate	I-ADR
constantly	I-ADR
but	O
it	O
would	O
come	O
and	O
go	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
no	O
symptoms	O
for	O
a	O
day	O
then	O
it	O
would	O
return	O
again.	O


I	O
remembered	O
reading	O
the	O
phamplet	O
that	O
comes	O
with	O
the	O
prescription	O
drugs	O
and	O
it	O
mentioning	O
some	O
of	O
symptoms	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
experiencing.	O


I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
a	O
day	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
any	O
mor.	O


I	O
think	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
a	O
better	O
alternative	O
to	O
lowering	O
cholesterol	O
than	O
such	O
a	O
potent	O
drug	O
that	O
can	O
cause	O
so	O
many	O
side	O
effects.	O


I	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
case-study	O
when	O
they	O
finally	O
take	O
this	O
drug	O
off	O
the	O
market.	O


I'm	O
not	O
sure	O
if	O
this	O
is	O
related	O
to	O
the	O
lipitor,	B-Drug
but	O
shortly	O
after	O
I	O
started	O
taking	O
it,	O
I	O
exprienced	O
complete	O
paralysis	B-ADR
in	O
my	O
forehead	O
(peripheral	O
neuropathy).	I-ADR


Went	O
to	O
a	O
neurologist,GP	O
and	O
ENT,	O
none	O
of	O
whom	O
have	O
ever	O
seen	O
this	O
kind	O
of	O
paralysis	B-ADR
(both	O
sides)	O
with	O
no	O
other	O
symptoms.	O


Has	O
any	O
one	O
else	O
come	O
across	O
this	O
symptom?	O
I	O
m	O
tempted	O
to	O
go	O
off	O
the	O
medicine	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
the	O
paralysis	B-ADR
goes	O
away.	O


It	O
really	O
lowered	O
my	O
cholestrol	O
a	O
lot,	O
so	O
I	O
hope	O
this	O
problem	O
isn;t	O
related.	O

as	O
Red	B-Drug

the	O

things	O
to	O

before	O

you	O

the	O

It	O

My	O

had	O
me	O
try	O
it	O
although	O
my	O

was	O
only	O
205.	O


I	O
told	O
her	O
about	O
my	O

but	O
she	O
thought	O
I	O
would	O
do	O
ok	O
on	O
it.	O


I	O
even	O
questioned	O
her	O
about	O
the	O
liver	B-Finding

it	O
can	O

but	O
she	O
said	O
it	O
hardly	O

happens.	O


In	O
less	O
than	O
two	O

I	O
was	O
so	O

I	O
thought	O
I	O
was	O
going	O
crazy.	O


I	O
worked	O
overnight	O
at	O
my	O

and	O
I	O
was	O
trying	O
to	O
do	O
things	O
so	O
fast	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
frustrate	O
myself.	O


My	O
brain	O
also	O
felt	O
like	O
it	O
was	O
kicked	O
into	O
high	O

as	O
if	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
constant	B-ADR

for	O
something.	O


I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
after	O
two	O
weeks	O
and	O
told	O
my	O
doctor.	O


She	O
said	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
she	O
had	O
never	O
heard	O
of	O
that	O
happening	O
to	O
anyone	O
before	O
and	O
recommended	O
I	O
continue	O
its'	O

I	O
stopped	O
and	O
now	O
refuse	O

it.	O


At	O
my	O

she	O
said	O
she	O
was	O

that	O
I	O
was	O

Yes,	O
it	O
did	O
a	O

the	O
side	O

are	O

I	O
would	O

I	O

I	O

Sure	O
it	O

at	O

I	O
told	O
my	O

I	O
was	O

He	O
commented	O
I	O
see	O
NO	O

you	O
to	O
be	O

(Even	O
though	O
he	O

the	O

Well	O
needless	O
to	O

that	O
was	O
the	O

I	O

him.	O


I	O
thought	O
I	O

or	O
some	O

that	O
has	O
the	O
symptoms	O
I	O
was	O

I	O
found	O
that	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
could	O
be	O
the	O
reason	O
for	O
all	O
of	O
these	O
symptoms.	O


So,	O
on	O
my	O
own,	O
I	O
stopped	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
(I	O
was	O
only	O
on	O
10mg	O

Within	O
48	O

I	O

(I've	O

my	O

my	O

What	O
is	O
the	O
evidence	O
of	O
benefit	O
for	O
primary	O

in	O

There	O
were	O
10,990	O
women	O
in	O
the	O
primary	O
prevention	O
trials	O
(28%	O
of	O
the	O
total).	O


Only	O
coronary	O

were	O
reported	O
for	O
women,	O

when	O
these	O

they	O
were	O
not	O
reduced	O
by	O
statin	O
therapy,	O
RR	O

[0.85-1.12].	O


Thus	O
the	O

Sudden	O

I	O

up	O
one	O

could	B-ADR

I	O
stopped	O

the	O

the	O

First	O
the	O

thought	O
I	O
had	O

in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

The	O

I	O

myself	O
off	O
this	O

that	O
my	O

Why	O
is	O
my	O

unaware	O
of	O
the	O

Why	O
did	O
I	O

20mg	O

I	O

I	O

I've	O
been	O
taking	O
cholesterol	O
lowering	O
meds	O
for	O
at	O
least	O
10	O
years	O
including	O
Mevacor,	B-Drug
Zocor,	B-Drug
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
Zetia.	B-Drug


My	O
cholesterol	O
went	O
from	O
398	O
to	O
260	O
on	O
40	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


This	O
year	O
I	O
was	O
given	O
80	O
mgs	O
of	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
Zetia	B-Drug
was	O
added	O
as	O
well.	O


Along	O
with	O
the	O
increased	O
dosage,	O
came	O
crippling	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	O
back,	B-ADR
neck	B-ADR
and	O
then	O
just	O
my	O
left	O
foot,	O
severe	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
neck	I-ADR
to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
I	O
couldn't	O
hold	O
it	O
up	O
without	O
an	O
effort,	O
increased	O
sinus	B-ADR
pain,	I-ADR
high	B-ADR
blood	I-ADR
pressure,	I-ADR
insomina,	B-ADR
blurred	B-ADR
thinking.	I-ADR


So	O
to	O
fix	O
all	O
these	O
problems,	O
I	O
was	O
given	O
lots	O
of	O
other	O
meds	O
and	O
tons	O
of	O
physical	O
therapy	O
and	O
exercise	O
each	O
day.	O


All	O
so	O
I	O
could	O
have	O
great	O
numbers.	O


Finally,	O
I	O
realized	O
enough	O
was	O
enough,	O
I	O
called	O
the	O
nurse	O
practitioner	O
to	O
say	O
I	O
was	O
stopping	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
she	O
was	O
not	O
really	O
happy	O
to	O
put	O
it	O
mildly.	O


I	O
know	O
my	O
cholesterol	B-Disease
will	O
always	O
be	O
high,	B-Disease
but	O
after	O
2	O
weeks	O
off	O
Lipitor,	B-Drug
I	O
feel	O
better	O
each	O
day	O
and	O
know	O
it's	O
not	O
my	O
age	O
causing	O
the	O
pain,	B-ADR
high	B-ADR
blood	I-ADR
pressure,	I-ADR
memory	B-ADR
loss,	I-ADR
dizzines.	B-ADR


I	O
started	O
experiencing	O
severe	O
leg	B-ADR
cramping	I-ADR
at	O
night	O
with	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
traveling	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
buddocks	B-ADR
and	O
stomach	B-ADR
as	O
well.	O


The	O
pain	B-ADR
was	O
so	O
bad	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
out	O
of	O
the	O
bed	O
and	O
had	O
to	O
crawl	O
to	O
get	O
to	O
the	O
bathroom	O
to	O
take	O
Advil.	B-Drug


I	O
asked	O
my	O
doctor	O
what	O
could	O
have	O
caused	O
this	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
probably	O
from	O
the	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


Recently	O
I	O
experienced	O
extreme	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
that	O
stretched	O
to	O
my	O
side	O
and	O
back.	O


The	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
came	O
suddenly	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
come	O
and	O
go	O
for	O
a	O
week	O
before	O
it	O
became	O
so	O
bad	O
I	O
could	B-ADR
not	I-ADR
sleep.	I-ADR


I	O
had	O
just	O
gotten	O
over	O
a	O
urinery	B-ADR
tract	I-ADR
infection	I-ADR
(one	O
of	O
the	O
side-effects)	O
and	O
I	O
thought	O
it	O
had	O
returned	O
but	O
the	O
symptoms	O
were	O
different.	O


I	O
still	O
had	O
the	O
urge	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
urinate	I-ADR
constantly	O
but	O
it	O
would	O
come	O
and	O
go	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
no	O
symptoms	O
for	O
a	O
day	O
then	O
it	O
would	O
return	O
again.	O


I	O
remembered	O
reading	O
the	O
phamplet	O
that	O
comes	O
with	O
the	O
prescription	O
drugs	O
and	O
it	O
mentioning	O
some	O
of	O
symptoms	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
experiencing.	O


I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
a	O
day	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
any	O
more	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
or	O
urgency.	B-ADR


I	O
also	O
had	O
been	O
experiencing	O
lack	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
energy	I-ADR
for	O
quite	O
some	O
time	O
and	O
I	O
attributed	O
this	O
to	O
stress	B-Finding
but	O
after	O
reading	O
this	O
website	O
I	O
feel	O
it	O
was	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
also.	O


I	O
don't	O
think	O
I	O
will	O
take	O
this	O
drug	O
anymore	O
and	O
since	O
I	O
read	O
that	O
taking	O
vitamin	B-Drug
C	I-Drug
can	O
help	O
you	O
with	O
your	O
cholesterol	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
will	O
try	O
this	O
method	O
instead.	O


I	O
think	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
a	O
better	O
alternative	O
to	O
lowering	O
cholesterol	O
than	O
such	O
a	O
potent	O
drug	O
that	O
can	O
cause	O
so	O
many	O
side	O
effects.	O


I	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
case-study	O
when	O
they	O
finally	O
take	O
this	O
drug	O
off	O
the	O
market.	O


Didn't	O
think	O
I	O
was	O
having	O
side	O
effects	O
till	O
I	O
read	O
here.	O


I've	O

(had	O

a	O
couple	O
of	O

I	O
began	O

The	O

that	O
it	O

It	O
scares	O
me	O

occassional	O

It	O
lowered	O
my	O
cholesterol,	O
to	O
be	O
sure.	O


But	O
it	O
also	O
significantly	O
lowered	O
my	O
quality	O
of	O
life.	O


This	O
website	O
has	O
been	O
an	O
absolute	O
lifeline	O
for	O
me.	O


My	O
doctor	O
had	O
seemed	O
so	O
completely	O
unwilling	O
to	O
accept	O
that	O
my	O
symptoms	O
could've	O
possibly	O
been	O
related	O
to	O
my	O
taking	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


However,	O
I	O
know	O
my	O
body	O
and	O
know	O
when	O
things	O
are	O
not	O
as	O
they	O
should	O
be.	O


I	O
have	O
been	O
feeling	O
this	O
way	O
since	O
almost	O
immediately	O
after	O
I	O
took	O
my	O
first	O
dose.	O


Hearing	O
that	O
so	O
many	O
other	O
people	O
have	O
experienced	O
the	O
same	O
exact	O
symptoms	O
as	O
me	O
has	O
given	O
me	O
the	O
courage	O
needed	O
to	O
STOP	O
this	O
medication.	O


So	O
many	O
of	O
my	O
family	O
members	O
and	O
friends	O
have	O
had	O
bad	O
reactions	O
to	O
this	O
stuff-	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
trust	O
it,	O
and	O
will	O
be	O
looking	O
for	O
another	O
way	O
to	O
get	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
under	O
control,	O
if	O
possible.	O


Be	O
very	O
careful	O
and	O
very	O
informed	O
before	O
you	O
start	O
any	O
new	O
medication.	O


Don't	O
always	O
trust	O
the	O
word	O
of	O
your	O
doctor	O
as	O
the	O
only	O
word	O
and	O
take	O
it	O
at	O
its	O
face	O
value.	O


When	O
it	O
comes	O
to	O
your	O

you	O
have	O
every	O
right	O

My	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
a	O
NY	O
neurologist,	O
then	O
to	O
a	O
neuromuscular	O
doctor	O
who	O
said	O
it	O
sounded	O

Lipitor,	B-Drug
even	O
though	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
off	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
almost	O
6	O

He	O
suggested	O

I	O

Went	O

No	O

the	O

The	O

did	O
bring	O
my	O

is	O
it	O
worth	O
having	O

to	O
achieve	O
that?.	O


Some	O

otherwise	O
I	O
put	O

put	O

Docs	O
now	O
actually	O

you	O
to	O

In	O
1977	O
(at	O

28)	O
with	O
a	O
'count'	O
of	O
10mmol/L	O
(385mg/dL),	O
a	O
VERY	O
careful	O
low-chol.	O


diet	O
made	O
virtually	O
NO	O
difference	O
to	O
my	O

So	O
I	O
went	O
onto	O
Zocor	O
(new-ish	O
then)	O
and	O
remained	O
on	O
it	O
for	O
21	O
years,	O
finally	O
on	O
a	O
dose	O
of	O
40mg/day	O
with	O
no	O
real	O
side	O

-	O
it	O
lowered	O
my	O

to	O
5.6mmol/L.	O


As	O
my	O
count	O
started	O
to	O
rise	O
again	O
to	O
7.8	O
in	O
1997	O
(at	O
age	O
48),	O
I	O
switched	O
to	O
Lipitor,	O
starting	O
with	O
20mg/day	O
and	O
then	O
40mg/day	O
which	O
dropped	O
my	O
count	O
A	O
LOT	O
to	O
just	O
5.1mmol/L	O
and	O
with	O
an	O
HDL	O
'good	O

count	O
of	O
1.6.	O


After	O
a	O
3-week	O
holiday	O
without	O
pills,	O
my	O
count	O
rose	O
to	O
10.4,	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
back	O
onto	O
40mg/day	O
of	O
Lipitor	O
-	O
but	O
my	O
count	O
was	O
still	O
only	O
6.7,	O
so	O
I	O
put	O
myself	O
onto	O
80mg/day	O
Lipitor	O
and	O
my	O
count	O
went	O
down	O
to	O
5.5	O
-	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
highest	O
dose	O
recommended.	O


I've	O

I	O

for	O
8.6	O

4.8	O

a	O

where	O

his	O

Before	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
I	O
never	O

I	O
then	O
called	O
my	O

him	O
about	O
my	O

and	O
told	O

he	O
was	O

After	O
one	O

off	O
the	O

I	O
still	O
have	O

went	O
in	O
for	O
another	O

he	O
said	O
he	O
didn't	O
thiink	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
side	O
effect	O
because	O
the	O
cramps	B-ADR
were	O
localized	O
and	O
felt	O
maybe	O
the	O
cramps	B-ADR
were	O
caused	O
by	O
a	O

He	O
drew	O

About	O
the	O

I	O
got	O
the	O

my	O

up	O
so	O
I	O
saw	O

I	O
don't	O

if	O
the	O
knee	O
and	O
leg	B-ADR

are	O
related	O
side	O

Anyway	O
I	O
asked	O
the	O

about	O
Liptior	B-Drug
side	O
effects	O
re.	O


leg	B-ADR
cramps	I-ADR
and	O
he	O
felt	O
that	O
the	O
side	O

could	O
be	O

and	O
that	O
the	O

could.	O


After	O

about	O
the	O

and	O
talking	O
to	O
several	O
people	O

all	O

Dr	O
changed	O
first	O
to	O
Vytorin	B-Drug
then	O
Pravachol.	B-Drug


Took	O
about	O
a	O

for	O
the	O

to	O
begin	O
with	O
Vytorin.	B-Drug


The	O
pravachol	B-Drug
started	O
the	O

again	O
in	O
about	O
3	O

I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
all	O

after	O
2	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
recurring	O

I	O
experienced	O
tighening	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
chest	I-ADR
and	O
leg	B-ADR
cramps.	I-ADR


I	O
really	O
didn't	O
have	O
a	O
bad	O
reaction	O
to	O
this	O
Medicatiion.	O


I	O
would	O
take	O
this	O
medicine	O
over	O
Niaspan	B-Drug
anyday!.	O


Took	O
10mg	O
lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
approximately	O
one	O

Experienced	O
lethargy,	B-ADR

in	I-ADR
arms,	I-ADR
trouble	B-ADR
sleeping,	I-ADR
irritability,	B-ADR
anxiety,	B-ADR
mild	B-ADR
depression.	I-ADR


Finally	O
went	O
off	O
all	O
statins	O
when	O
I	O
experienced	O
a	O
particularly	O
bad	O
reaction	O
when	O
the	O
doctor,	O
with	O
a	O
gleam	O
in	O
his	O
eye,	O
recommended	O
combining	O
lipitor	B-Drug
with	O
Zetia.	B-Drug


The	O
results	O
were	O
so	O
bad	O
in	O
terms	O
of	O
side-effects	O
that	O
I	O
ceased	O
all	O
statins	O
and	O
discontinued	O
the	O
Zetia	B-Drug
in	O
short	O
order.	O


I	O
now	O
take	O
no	O
statins,	O
no	O
Zetia.	B-Drug


Individually	O
they	O
have	O
their	O
own	O
problems;	O
combined	O
they	O
are	O
extremely	O
dangerous	O
and,	O
in	O
my	O
opinion,	O
should	O
be	O
banned	O
as	O
a	O
combination	O
therapy.	O


Probably	O
safe	O
in	O
short	O
doses,	O
a	O
very	O

candidate	O
for	O

use	O
unless	O
closely	O

used	O
in	O
lowest	O

Would	O
warn	O
other	O
patients	O
to	O
NOT	O
COMBINE	O
LIPITOR	B-Drug
OR	O
OTHER	O
STATIN	O
WITH	O
Zetia,	B-Drug
a	O
common	O
tactic	O
that	O
you	O
will	O
most	O
likely	O
regret.	O


Let	O
the	O
pharmaceutical	O
reps	O
take	O
the	O
meds	O
they	O
peddle	O
and	O
get	O
them	O
off	O

of	O

out	O

and	O

to	O
cowboy-style	O
doctors	O
who	O
are	O
little	O
less	O
than	O
drug-pushers.	O


I've	O
not	O
started	O
the	O

it	O
was	O
perscribed	O
to	O
me	O
by	O
my	O

for	O

I've	O

researched	O
this	O

and	O
I've	O
found	O
nothing	O

about	O
it.	O


I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
try	O
alternative	O
(herbal)	O
medications	O
to	O
rise	O
my	O
good	O

Afraid	O

and	O
I	O
don't	O
want	O
to	O
jepordize	O
my	O
health	O
by	O
adding	O
a	O

to	O
my	O

After	O
about	O
10	O
weeks	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
I	O
suddenly	O
developed	O

The	O

the	O

that	O

I	O

December	O
2009	O
and	O
stopped	O
after	O
4	O

During	O
this	O

I	O
experienced	O

in	I-ADR
both	B-ADR

sometimes	O
in	O
the	O
neck	B-ADR
also,	O
causing	O
me	O
to	O
wake	O
several	O

each	O

Pain	B-ADR
was	I-ADR
worse	I-ADR
in	O
the	O
morning	O
but	O
rarely	O
went	O
away	O
completely	O
during	O
the	O

Most	O

it	O
was	O

In	O

However	O
I	O
do	O
believe	O
that	O
any	O
Doctor	O

should	O
make	O
it	O
abundantly	O
clear	O
to	O
the	O

that	O
very	O
serious	O
consequences	O

could	O
effect	O

I	O
believe	O
that	O
failure	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
is	O
a	O
serious	O
deriliction	O

that	O

That	O

I	O
have	O
been	O
on	O
and	O
off	O
all	O
the	O
statins	O
for	O
about	O
3	O

that	O

Severe	B-ADR
muscle	I-ADR
pain.	I-ADR


Severe	B-ADR
knee	I-ADR
and	O
back	B-ADR
pain.	B-ADR


Several	O
doctors	O
suggested	O
knee	O
surgery.	O


I	O
went	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
knees	O
are	O
fine,	O
muscle	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
dissapeared.	O


I	O
tried	O
it	O
again	O
because	O
my	O
doctor	O
insisted	O
the	O
drug	O
did	O
not	O
cause	O
the	O
problem	O
since	O
my	O
liver	O
lab	O
tests	O
were	O
good.	O


Tried	O
a	O
second	O
time,	O
severe	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
came	O
back	O
within	O
one	O
week.	O


lowered	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
miraculously.	O


I'd	O
rather	O
have	O
a	O
heart	B-Disease
attack	I-Disease
than	O
live	O
with	O
such	O
pain.	B-ADR


Always	O
very	B-ADR
fatigued	I-ADR
and	O
sleepy	B-ADR
immediately	O
after	O
taking	O
the	O
drug	O
almost	O
like	O
a	O
sleeping	O
pill	O
causes.	O


So	O
I	O
take	O
it	O
before	O
going	O
to	O
sleep.	O


Strange	O
type	O
food	B-ADR
cravings	I-ADR
e.g.	O


rich	O
fatty	O

mayo,	O
eggs,	O
and	O
hot	O

or	O

cravings	O
too,	O
and	O
I'm	O
not	O
overweight	O
or	O
pregnant	O
either.	O


Periodic	O
or	O
sporadic	B-ADR
lower	I-ADR
abdominal	I-ADR
cramping	I-ADR
without	O
the	O

and	O
thigh	B-ADR
soreness.	I-ADR


Works	O
wonders	O
on	O
my	O
bad	O
cholesterol	O
and	O
tri's	O
but	O
now	O
my	O
good	B-ADR
cholesterol	I-ADR
is	I-ADR
whacked,	I-ADR
lowered.	I-ADR


Ratio	O
is	O
also	O
a	O
lot	O
better	O
but	O
the	O
lowering	O
of	O
my	O
good	O
cholesterol	O
has	O
my	O
doctor	O
thinking	O
I	O
need	O
yet	O
another	O
drug	O
to	O
bring	O
good	O
cholesterol	O
back	O
up.	O


Left	O
shoulder	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
and	O
right	O
hip	O
and	O
muscle	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
over	O
3	O
weeks.	O


I'm	O
a	O
physician	O
and	O
initially	O
figured	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
was	O
sports	O
related	O
(although	O
being	O
right	O
handed,	O
I	O
was	O
suspicious	O
about	O
the	O
unilateral	O
left	O
shoulder	B-ADR
pain).	I-ADR


I	O
stuck	O
it	O
out	O
for	O
3	O
weeks	O
until	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
significant	B-ADR
limp.	I-ADR


Then	O
stopped	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
3	O
days	O
ago	O
and	O
noticed	O
a	O
very	O
significant	O
mitigation	O
of	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
-	O
about	O
80%	O
resolved	O
already.	O


The	O
drug	O
worked	O
wonders	O
on	O
cholesterol	O
(down	O
80	O
in	O
4	O
months),	O
but	O
I'll	O
be	O
starting	O
an	O
alternative	O
shortly.	O


had	O
a	O
heart-attack	B-ADR
in	O
Jan.	O


06.	O


it	O
will	O
kill	O
some	O
people.	O


I	O
was	O
a	O
vibrant	O

until	O
Easter	O
Saturday,	O
2006.	O


On	O
Easter	O
Sunday	O
my	O
ankles,	B-ADR
feet,	B-ADR
wrists,	B-ADR
and	O
knees	B-ADR
seized	B-ADR
up.	I-ADR


I	O
am	O
now	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
I	O
am	O
assured	O
that	O
I	O
will	O
make	O
a	O
full	O
recovery	O
within	O
six	O
months.	O


I	O
shuffle	B-ADR
when	I-ADR
I	I-ADR

and	O
I	O
am	O
only	O
just	O
coping.	O


I	O
am	O
not	O
quite	O
a	O
vegetable,	O
but	O
not	O
far	O
off.	O


I	O
started	O
using	O
the	O
drug	O
in	O
Sept.	O


2005.	O


In	O
October/November	O
I	O
noticed	O
my	O
hands	B-ADR
were	I-ADR
nowhere	I-ADR
near	I-ADR
as	I-ADR
strong	I-ADR
as	I-ADR
they	I-ADR
once	I-ADR
were	I-ADR
-	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
old	O
age.	O


I	O
also	O
had	O
a	O
strange	O
senistivity	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
the	B-ADR
palms	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
soles	I-ADR
of	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
feet,	I-ADR
also	O
in	O
my	O
scalp	B-ADR
-	O
it	O
was	O
uncomfortable	O
blowing	O
my	O
hair	O
dry.	O


It	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
tingling,	B-ADR
just	O
a	O
sensitivity.	B-ADR


In	O
November,	O
I	O
was	O
running,	O
and	O
my	O
feet	B-ADR
felt	I-ADR
like	I-ADR
led	I-ADR
-	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
old	O
age.	O


In	O
December,	O
my	O
ankles	B-ADR
started	I-ADR
aching	I-ADR
-	O
gee,	O
am	O
I	O
getting	O
old!	O
In	O
January,	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
go	O
to	O
the	O
gym,	O
and	O
I	O
think	O
that	O
this	O
is	O
where	O
my	O
problems	O
really	O
started.	O


My	O
already	O
over-streesed	B-ADR
muscles,	I-ADR
over	O
a	O
short	O
period	O
of	O
time,	O
went	O
into	O
meltdown.	O


This	O
drug	O
is	O
a	O
terrible,	O
terrible	O
drug	O
and	O
should	O
not	O
be	O
prescribed	O
for	O
anyone.	O


Over	O
the	O
past	O
three	O
years	O
the	O
drug	O
has	O
definately	O
worked	O
but	O
I	O
have	O
developed	O
almost	O
a	O
dibilitating	B-ADR
problem	I-ADR
with	I-ADR
both	I-ADR
of	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
arms.	I-ADR


I	O
am	O
unable	O
to	O
move	O
them	O
in	O
any	O
direction	O
but	O
the	O
normal	O
motion.	O


It	O
has	O
got	O
to	O
the	O
point	O
where	O
turning	O
over	O
in	O
bed	O
wakes	O
me	O
up	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
it	O
causes.	O


I	O
have	O
had	O
a	O
blood	O
test	O
to	O
determine	O
if	O
Lipior	B-Drug
is	O
causing	O
this	O
serious	O
problem	O
and	O
the	O
results	O
said	O
no	O
it	O
wasn't.	O


However,	O
I	O
even	O
went	O
to	O
an	O
orthopdetic	O
surgeon	O
and	O
after	O
he	O
checked	O
me	O
out,	O
he	O
looked	O
at	O
the	O
drugs	O
that	O
I	O
take	O
(i	O
am	O
also	O
a	O
type	O
2	O
diabetic)	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
ahh,	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


more	O
people	O
taking	O
this	O
drug	O
come	O
to	O
me	O
with	O
problems	O
like	O
this	O
.	O


I	O
have	O
an	O
annual	O
physical	O
on	O
8/27	O
and	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
tell	O
the	O
doctor	O
I'm	O
stopping	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
to	O
see	O
what	O
happens.	O


Live	B-ADR
damage	I-ADR

80-90%	O

5-31-06.	O


I'm	O
in	O
the	O
hospital	O
waiting	O
a	O
liver	O
transplant	O
after	O
taking	O
this	O
drug	O
for	O
only	O
2	O
months.	O


For	O
the	O
most	O
part,	O
no	O
side	O
effects.	O


Some	O
gas	B-ADR
early	O
on,	O
which	O
has	O
subsided.	O


I	O
do	O
have	O
some	O
weight	O
around	O
the	O
middle	O
which	O
I	O
wasn't	O
noticing	O
so	O
much	O
before,	O
but	O
this	O
may	O
be	O
due	O
to	O
fact	O
I'm	O
now	O
in	O
my	O
early	O
40's.	O


I've	O
started	O
exercising/dieting	O
more	O
and	O
lost	O
15	O
pounds	O
in	O
last	O
month,	O
but	O
not	O
around	O
the	O
middle	O
much.	O


Some	O
darkness	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
urine,	I-ADR
but	O
I	O
think	O
it's	O
due	O
to	O
not	O
enough	O
fluids.	O


Nonetheless,	O
I'm	O
very	O
happy	O
with	O
the	O
drug.	O


Went	O
from	O
341	O
to	O
220	O
using	O
20mgs	O
despite	O
the	O

I	O

the	O

are	O

from	O
taking	O
the	O

Sudden,	O
very	O
severe	B-ADR
urinary	I-ADR

It	O
took	O
me	O
8	O
years	O
to	O
figure	O
out	O
why	O
I	O
was	O
getting	O
these	O
very	O
sudden	O
and	O
very	O
severe	B-ADR
infections	I-ADR
every	O
3	O

5	O
months.	O


WHen	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor,	B-Drug
the	O
infections	B-ADR
stopped,	O
too.	O


I	O
developed	O
constipation	B-ADR
and	O
flatulence,	B-ADR
which	O
I	O
had	O
rarely	O
suffered	O
from	O
before	O
taking	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


I	O
developed	O
hemorrhoids	B-ADR
and	O
even	O
after	O
increasing	O
fluids	O
and	O
correcting	O
the	O
constipation,	B-ADR
they	O
did	O
not	O
go	O
away.	O


After	O
a	O
year	O
of	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
my	O
urine	B-ADR
started	O
feeling	O
as	O
if	O
it	O
was	O
corrosive	B-ADR
when	O
it	O
touched	O
my	O
skin	O
and	O
I	O
developed	O
a	O
rash	B-ADR
that	O
I	O
could	O
not	O
get	O
rid	O
of.	O


About	O
a	O
month	O
ago,	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
get	O
muscle	B-ADR
problems	I-ADR
in	O
my	O
legs	B-ADR
that	O
made	O
it	O
difficult	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
from	O
a	O
sitting	O
position.	O


I	O
have	O
also	O
been	O
experience	O
tremendous	B-ADR
neck	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	O
my	O
shoulders	O
that	O
was	O
causing	O
severe	B-ADR
headaches.	I-ADR


After	O
two	O
weeks	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
my	O
rash	B-ADR
and	O
the	O
hemorrhoids	B-ADR
are	O
gone.	O


The	O
weakness	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
legs	I-ADR
seems	O
to	O
have	O
diminished	O
somewhat	O
in	O
the	O
last	O
day	O
or	O
so,	O
making	O
it	O
easier	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
from	O
a	O
sitting	O
position.	O


My	O
neck	O
is	O
still	O
a	O
problem	O
and	O
has	O
not	O
really	O
improved	O
but	O
I	O
am	O
hoping	O
that	O
it	O
will	O
get	O
better	O
over	O
time.	O


Severe	B-ADR
back	I-ADR
and	O
neck	B-ADR
pains	B-ADR
that	O
led	O
to	O
severe	B-ADR

Stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
after	O
3-4	O
weeks.	O


since	O
then	O
it	O
has	O
cleared	O
up.	O


Definitely	O

but	O
I'm	O
44	O
and	O
I	O
suppose	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
part	O
of	O
menopause	B-Finding
on	O
its	O
way.	O


lowered	O
overall	O
cholesterol	O
and	O
my	O
hdl	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
59	O
from	O
35,	O
and	O
triglycerides	O
went	O
down	O
but	O
not	O
enough.	O


LDL	O
down	O
too	O
but	O
not	O

so	O
taking	O

Worked	O

he's	O
upped	O

It	O
is	O

the	O

I	O

that	O
it	O

then	O
a	O

Interestingly,	O
my	O

took	O
me	O
off	O

a	O
week	O

I	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O
a	O

like	O

Within	O
this	O

a	O

The	O
tightening	B-ADR

was	O
causing	O

I	O
am	O
now	O

Hope	O
I	O
continue	O
to	O
improve---will	O
have	O
to	O
now	O
address	O

as	O
it	O
worked	O

with	O
that.	O


I	O
have	O
been	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
40mg.	I-Drug


for	O
2	O

GREAT	O

Went	O
from	O

In	O
the	O

I	O
have	O

experiancing	O
TERRIBLE	B-ADR

I'm	O
a	O

so	O
I	O
know	O
all	O
to	O
well	O
what	O
these	O
side	O
effects	O
are	O
from.	O


I've	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it,	O
but	O
the	O
effects	O
are	O
a	O
slow	O
go.	O


I	O
would	O
NOT	O
reccomend	O
lipitor	B-Drug
to	O
anyone.	O


Tiredness,	B-ADR
both	O
physical	O
and	O
mental.	O


Brain	B-ADR
fog.	I-ADR


Progressively	O
got	O

of	O
treatment.	O


When	O
I	O
started	O
taking	O
it,	O
no	O
immediate	O
side	O
effects.	O


I'd	O
assumed	O
that	O
the	O
tiredness	B-ADR
was	O
just	O
one	O
of	O
those	O
things	O
that	O
happens	O
with	O
age,	O
like	O
needing	O
reading	O
glasses,	O
or	O
joints	B-Finding
aching	I-Finding
in	O
the	O

Discovered	O
otherwise	O
when	O
I	O
left	O
my	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
at	O
a	O
friend's	O
house,	O
asked	O
her	O
to	O
post	O
it	O
back	O
to	O
me.	O


By	O
the	O
time	O
it	O
arrived	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
later	O
I	O
was	O
feeling	O
better	O
than	O
I	O
had	O
for	O
months.	O


Had	O
previously	O
been	O
on	O
Pravastatin,	B-Drug
my	O
doc	O
switched	O
me	O
because	O
cholesterol	O
was	O
still	O
too	O
high,	O
but	O
it	O
didn't	O
have	O
these	O
side-effects	O
either.	O


Will	O
ask	O
about	O
whether	O
any	O
point	O
in	O
switching	O
back	O
but	O
won't	O
take	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
again.	O


Frankly	O
prefer	O
quality	O
of	O

to	O
quantity!.	O


Severe	B-ADR

heel	I-ADR
and	O

Muscle	B-ADR

in	I-ADR
left	O
lower	O

Took	O
10	O
mg	O
daily	O
for	O
four	O
months,	O
then	O
finally	O
had	O
to	O
stop	O
due	O
to	O
inablity	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
walk	I-ADR
down	O

due	O
to	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
(I	O
am	O
41,	O
and	O
run	O
a	O
5k	O
every	O

so	O
this	O
should	O

Under	O

to	O
wait	O
for	O
full	O

then	O
try	O
again	O
at	O
1/2	O

if	O
pain	B-ADR
returns	O
I	O
will	O
have	O
to	O
seek	O
other	O
alternatives	O
besides	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


The	O
drug	O
did	O
knock	O
my	O
cholesteral	O
down	O
by	O
55%,	O
so	O
I	O
have	O
motivation	O
to	O
try	O
and	O
make	O
it	O
work.	O


I	O
have	O
been	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
over	O
a	O
year	O
and	O
it	O
did	O
lower	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
from	O
299	O
to	O
220,	O
but	O
I,	O
too,	O
have	O
been	O
having	O
side	O
effects,	O
I	O
guess	O
now,	O
that	O
might	O
be	O
attributed	O
to	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


I	O
have	O
this	O
weird	O
dizzy/vertigo/un-balanced-type	B-ADR
feeling	I-ADR
sometimes.	O


It	O
is	O
a	O
feeling	O
like	O
I	O
need	O
to	O

to	O
something,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
make	O
my	O

So	O
for	O
now	O
I	O
stay	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
with	O
the	O
hope	O
that	O
my	O
symptoms	O
will	O
disapear.	O


My	O
Cholesterol	O
is.	O


I	O
used	O
to	O
take	O
Provachol	B-Drug
(sp?)but	O
I	O
found	O
it	O
caused	O
extreme	B-ADR
bloating.	I-ADR


It	O
also	O
seem	O
to	O
increase	B-ADR
my	I-ADR
heart	I-ADR
rate	I-ADR
therefore	O
could	B-ADR
not	I-ADR
sleep	I-ADR
well.	I-ADR


I	O
requested	O
to	O
take	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
(10mg).	O


I	O
have	O
been	O
taking	O
it	O
for	O
about	O
three	O
months	O
now.	O


I	O
will	O
go	O
for	O
a	O
blood	O
test	O
within	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
so	O
we'll	O
see	O
how	O
good	O
it	O
did	O
its	O
job.	O


As	O
far	O
as	O
side	O
effects	O
are	O
concerned,	O
I	O
find	O
that	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
also	O
causes	O
bloating	B-ADR
and	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
gas	B-ADR
build	O
up	O
although	O
not	O
as	O
badly	O
as	O
my	O
previous	O
medication.	O


I'm	O
finding	O
it	O
difficult	O
to	O
fit	O
into	O
my	O
clothes	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
bloating.	B-ADR


I	O
also	O
find	O
that	O
it	O
makes	O
me	O
a	O
bit	O
drowsy,	B-ADR
almost	O
like	O
a	O
sleeping	O
pill.	O


I	O
therefore	O
take	O
it	O
at	O
bedtime	O
but	O
my	O
sleep	B-ADR
is	I-ADR
not	I-ADR
very	I-ADR
sound	I-ADR
and	O
therefore	O
not	O
refreshing.	O


I	O
developed	O
a	O
pain	B-ADR
that	O
seems	O
to	O
originate	O
at	O
the	O
base	O
of	O
my	O
neck,	B-ADR
travel	O
down	O
to	O
my	O
shoulder	O
blades	O
and	O
then	O
run	O
to	O
my	O
shoulders,	O
elbow	O
and	O
wrist.	O


I	O
first	O
attributed	O
this	O
to	O
work	O
stress	O
because	O
I	O
do	O
a	O
great	O
deal	O
of	O
computer	O
work.	O


I	O
thought	O
perhaps	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
getting	O
tendonitis	B-Disease
looking	O
at	O
th.	O


I	O
have	O
begun	O
to	O
take	O
charge	O
of	O
fighting	O
back	O
against	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
and	O
have	O
been	O
taking	O
multivitamins,	O
B	B-Drug
complex,	I-Drug
CoQ10,	B-Drug
and	O
GasX	B-Drug
for	O
bloating.	B-ADR


I	O
can	O
honestly	O
say	O
that	O
today	O
is	O
the	O
first	O
day	O
in	O
months	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
felt	O
really	O
well.	O


very	O
little	O
gas,	B-ADR
almost	O
no	O
pain.	B-ADR


I'll	O
keep	O
tabs	O
on	O
this	O
and	O
will	O
report	O
back	O
on	O
my	O
ldh	O
levels.	O


My	O
father	O
used	O
to	O
take	O
this	O

and	O
also	O

his	O

I	O

the	O

who	O

below	O

neurosurgeons,	O
who	O

this	O
would	O
tell	O
you	O
not	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
all	O

And	O
just	O
because	O

once	O

Now	O
after	O
2+	O

was	I-ADR

so	O
that	O
sometimes	O
I	O
had	O

a	I-ADR

funny.	I-ADR


Thought	O
I	O
might	O
need	O
hip	O
replacement	O
(age	O
71),	O
but	O
it	O
dawned	O
on	O
me	O
that	O
maybe	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
might	O
be	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
that	O
too.	O


I	O
cut	O

again	O
in	O

Now	O
after	O
one	O

I	O

that	O

any	O
more.	O


My	O
left	O

and	I-ADR

that	O
hurt	B-ADR
from	O

are	O
now	O

I	O
hope	O
from	O
just	O
taking	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
no	O
perm	O
damage	O
is	O
done.	O


The	O
pain	B-ADR
is	O
unbearable.	O


I	O
was	O
down	O
to	O
a	O
level	O
4	O
and	O
now	O
hitting	O
10	O
for	O
parts	O
of	O
each	O

I	O
told	O
the	O
dr.	O


I	O
felt	O
socked	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
arm,	I-ADR
he	O
thinks	O
my	O
chronic	B-Disease
problem	I-Disease
is	O
just	O
getting	O
worse.	O


I	O
hope	O
he	O
is	O
wrong	O
because	O
I	O
cannot	O
take	O
this	O
much	O
longer.	O


I	O

My	O

Both	O

For	O
me,	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
wonder	O
drug.	O


This	O
is	O
the	O
same	O
poster	O
as	O
the	O
previous	O
posting.	O


I	O
notice	O
a	O
poster	O
attributed	O
Bell's	B-Disease
palsy	I-Disease
to	O
lipitor.	O


I	O
too	O
had	O
Bell's,	B-Disease
I	O
went	O
back	O
and	O
looked	O
at	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
chart	O
and	O
found	O
I	O
got	O
Bell's	B-Disease
before	O
I	O
started	O
on	O
lipitor.	B-Drug


There	O
seems	O
to	O
be	O
a	O
consistent	O
occurence	O
of	O
muscle	B-Finding
pain	I-Finding
and/or	O
liver	B-Finding
problems	I-Finding
but	O
I	O
wonder	O
how	O
many	O
other	O
problems	O
are	O
not	O
really	O
attributable	O
to	O
lipitor	B-Drug
eg	O
see	O
my	O
Bell's	B-Disease
palsy.	I-Disease


Also	O
I	O
get	O
night	B-ADR
muscle	I-ADR
cramps	I-ADR
but	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
occasional	O
muscle	B-Finding
cramps	I-Finding
at	O
night	O
since	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
child,	O
Maybe	O
my	O
memory	O
isn't	O
as	O
good	O
as	O
it	O
was	O
but	O
I'm	O
70	O
and	O
I	O
still	O
passed	O
one	O
of	O
the	O
hardest	O
bar	O
exams	O
in	O
the	O
country	O
less	O
than	O
2	O
years	O
ago.	O


However	O
I	O
don't	O
doubt	O
that	O
some	O
unlucky	O
people	O
are	O
having	O
bad	O
side	O
effects,	O
I	O
just	O
wonder	O
about	O
some	O
of	O
the	O
more	O
esoteric	O
ones.	O

was	O

The	O
only	O
problem	O
is	O
I	O
feel	O
I	O

the	O

would	O
advise	O

very	O

before	O

I'm	O

him	O

The	O

was	O
misadventure.	O


The	O

decided	O
that	O
the	O
20	O

reasonable,	O
and	O
that	O
the	O

had	O
not	O

So	O
much	O
for	O
SPCs,	O
PILs,	O
and	O
the	O
CSM's	O
Pharmacovigilance	O
reports,	O
all	O
of	O
which	O
state	O
that	O
the	O

is	O
10	O

and	O
that	O

be	O
used	O
with	O
caution	O
by	O
patients	O
over	O

with	O

now	O
(after	O

they	O

my	O

as	O
well!!	O
The	O

I	O
started	O

about	O
3	O

I	O
started	O
at	O

then	O
my	O

doubled	O
it	O
to	O
40	O
and	O
kept	O
wanting	O
me	O
to	O
double	O
it	O
again	O
to	O
80.	O


After	O
me	O
telling	O
him	O
for	O

I	O
would	O
not	O
do	O
this.	O


I	O
gave	O
it	O
(about	O
2	O

decided	O
to	O

Well,	O
let	O
me	O
tell	O
you	O

I	O
finally	O

as	O
the	O

He	O
examined	O
me	O
and	O
could	O
not	O
find	O
any	O

and	O
asked	O
me	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
done	O
anything	O
different	O
with	O
my	O

I	O
told	O
him	O
I	O
had	O
increased	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
he	O
suggested	O
that	O
I	O
stop	O

it	O
ASAP.	O


I	O
only	O
stopped	O

it	O
last	O

and	O
I	O
am	O

that	O
I	O

feel	O
better	O
(I	O

I	O

pain	I-ADR
and	O
weakness	B-ADR
after	O
taking	O
only	O
a	O
few	O
doses	O
of	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


My	O
legs	B-ADR
were	I-ADR
so	I-ADR
weak	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
tired	I-ADR
I	O
could	B-ADR
hardly	I-ADR
walk	I-ADR
up	O

down	O

I	O
went	O
off	O
the	O
drug	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
and	O
all	O
the	O
symptoms	O
subsided.	O


At	O
my	O
doctor's	O
suggestion,	O
I	O
went	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
again	O
and	O
experienced	O
the	O
same	O
symptoms.	O


This	O
was	O
with	O
only	O
a	O
small	O
dosage	O
(I	O
think	O
it	O
was	O
10mg).	O


I	O
could	O
not	O
function;	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
felt	O
such	O
weakness.	B-ADR


I	O
am	O
now	O
taking	O
Zocor,	B-Drug
which	O
certainly	O
has	O
side	O
effects,	O
but	O
I	O
can	O
function.	O


I	O
started	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
after	O
my	O
cholesterol	B-Disease
climbed	I-Disease
to	O
310.	O


I	O
Did	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
because	O
I	O
am	O
a	O
vegetarian,	O
a	O
health	O
conscious	O
person	O
and	O
dislike	O
taking	O
medicines,	O
but	O
my	O
doctor,	O
an	O
endocrynologist,	O
strongly	O
recommended	O
it.	O


The	O
first	O
few	O
months	O
I	O
was	O
not	O
aware	O
of	O
any	O
side	O
effects,	O
but	O
about	O
a	O
month	O
ago	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
experience	O
wrist	B-ADR
pain,	I-ADR
I	O
thought	O
it	O
was	O
my	O
pilates	O
class,	O
but	O
although	O
I	O
rested	O
for	O
2	O
months	O
from	O
the	O
class,	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
continued.	O


Then	O
about	O
two	O
weeks	O
ago,	O
I	O
got	O
very	O
bad	O
cramps	B-ADR
in	O
my	O
toes,	O
they	O
curled	O
down	O
and	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
was	O
terrible.	O


About	O
a	O
week	O
ago	O
I	O
was	O
taking	O
a	O
bath	O
and	O
my	O
muscles	B-ADR
in	B-ADR
my	I-ADR
lower	I-ADR
abdomen	I-ADR
started	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
contract	I-ADR
then	O
the	O
cramp	B-ADR
got	O
higher.	O


I	O
got	O
scared	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
having	O
something	O
bad.	O


After	O
the	O
cramps	B-ADR
one	O
night	O
I	O
had	O
such	O
tiredness	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	O
left	O
leg	B-ADR
that	O
I	O
could	B-ADR
hardly	I-ADR
walk,	I-ADR
I	O
thought	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
my	O
high	O
heels	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
worn	O
all	O
day.	O


Then	O
2	O
days	O
ago	O
I	O
woke	O
up	O
with	O
a	O
swollen	B-ADR
foot,	I-ADR
it	O
was	O
very	O
painful	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
walk.	I-ADR


That	O
was	O
it.	O


I	O
suspected	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
came	O
to	O
the	O
internet	O
and	O
read	O
the	O
same	O
side	O
effects	O
in	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
people	O
posting	O
their	O
experiences	O
with	O
this	O
drug.	O


I	O
even	O
thought	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
ALS	B-Disease
since	O
a	O
friend	O
of	O
mine	O
died	O
of	O
it.	O


It	O
is	O
amazing	O
the	O
amount	O
of	O
people	O
that	O
also	O
thought	O
the	O
same	O
in	O
this	O
list.	O


Thanks	O
God	O
for	O
the	O
Internet.	O


I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
this	O
medicine	O
2	O
days	O
ago,	O
I	O
hope	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
get	O
rid	O
of	O
these	O
effects	O
and	O
that	O
they	O
are	O
not	O
permanent.	O


I	O
do	O
not	O
recommend	O
it,	O
unless	O
it	O
is	O
life	O
threatening	O
and	O
then	O
only	O
take	O
it	O
for	O
a	O
short	O
time.	O


Was	O
on	O
Provachol.	B-Drug


Dr	O
switched	O
me	O
to	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
since	O
he	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
more	O
effective.	O


After	O
78	O
days	O
on	O
Lipitor,	B-Drug
I	O
had	O
constant	B-ADR
low	I-ADR
level	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	O
my	O
butt	O
and	O
upper	O
thighs.	O


Strong	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
would	O
come	O
and	O
go	O
randomly.	O


There	O
would	O
be	O
spikes	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
so	I-ADR
severe	I-ADR
that	O
I	O
felt	O
like	O
I	O
would	O
collapse.	O


Would	O
have	O
to	O
stop	O
standing/walking	O
and	O
sit	O
down	O
for	O
5	O
or	O
10	O
minutes.	O


After	O
I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor,	B-Drug
the	O
pain	B-ADR
gradually	O
subsided	O
over	O
a	O
9	O
month	O
period.	O


I	O
was	O
pain	B-ADR
free	O
for	O
a	O
few	O
months,	O
but	O
the	O
same	O
pain	B-ADR
has	O
returned	O
and	O
has	O
been	O
with	O
me	O
for	O
the	O
past	O
5	O
months.	O


I	O
now	O
wonder	O
if	O
this	O
is	O
a	O
chronic	B-Finding
pain	I-Finding
condition.	I-Finding


I	O
Have	O
been	O
on	O
lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
several	O
years.	O


I	O
have	O
noticed	O
over	O
the	O
last	O
few	O
years	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
not	O
been	O
feeling	O
well.	O


The	O
last	O
couple	O
of	O
months	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
suffering	O
with	O
vertigo.	B-ADR


I	O
have	O
had	O
all	O
kinds	O
of	O
test	O
and	O
they	O
all	O
come	O
up	O
negative.	O


I	O
decided	O
to	O
go	O
off	O
lipitor	B-Drug
about	O
three	O
days	O
ago	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
this	O
is	O
causing	O
it.	O


I	O
have	O
a	O
freind	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
problem	O
and	O
is	O
on	O
lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
about	O
the	O
same	O
amount	O
of	O
time	O
as	O
I	O
have	O
been	O
on	O
it.	O


I'm	O
hoping	O
that	O
this	O
dizziness	B-ADR
will	O
go	O
away	O
in	O
time	O
now	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
stopped	O
lipitor.	B-Drug


None	O
of	O
my	O
doctors	O
will	O
admit	O
that	O
is	O
lipitor	B-Drug
causing	O
the	O
problem.	O


Started	O
on	O
lipitor	B-Drug
about	O
6	O
months	O
ago.	O


2-3	O
weeks	O
ago	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
MD	O
with	O
sore	B-ADR
neck/arms	B-ADR
(especially	O
left)	O
feeling	O
of	O
breathlessness	B-ADR
and	O
anxiety,	B-ADR
feeling	B-ADR
like	I-ADR
something	I-ADR
was	I-ADR
going	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
happen.	I-ADR


MD	O
told	O
me	O
I	O
was	O
depressed	B-ADR
and	O
said	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
was	O
not	O
the	O
problem.	O


I	O
decided	O
to	O
do	O
some	O
research	O
myself	O
and	O
found	O
this	O
website.	O


I	O
immediately	O
stopped	O
taking	O
lipitor	B-Drug
a	O
day	O
ago	O
and	O
am	O
experiencing	O
weakness	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
both	I-ADR
arms	I-ADR
especially	O
left.	O


I	O
am	O
very	O
jittery	B-ADR
and	O
tingly	B-ADR
and	O
itchy.	B-ADR


I	O
feel	O
like	O
I	O
am	O
climbing	O
the	O
walls.	O


This	O
is	O
a	O
terrible	O
medicine!!!	O
I	O
will	O
never	O
take	O
it	O
again!!	O
It	O
should	O
be	O
taken	O
off	O
the	O
shelves!!!.	O


I	O
felt	O
like	O
I	O
had	O
been	O
running	O
a	O
marathon.	O


My	O
legs	B-ADR
ached,	I-ADR
felt	B-ADR
weak,	I-ADR
calf	B-ADR
muscles	I-ADR
painful	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
touch-	I-ADR
extreme	B-ADR
fatigue,	I-ADR
headaches.	B-ADR


Lipitor	B-Drug
had	O
the	O
same	O
side	O
effects	O
as	O
Zocor	B-Drug
and	O
confirmed	O
that	O
Zocor	B-Drug
caused	O
myalgia,	B-Finding
neuralgia,	B-Finding
insomnia,	B-Finding
dementia,	B-Finding
polyneuropathy,	B-Finding
rhabdomyolisis,	B-Finding
subdural	B-Finding
hematoma,	I-Finding
coma,	B-Finding
and	O
pain,	B-Finding
pain	B-Finding
pain.	B-Finding


Lipitor	B-Drug
seems	O
to	O
cause	O
even	O
more	O
nerve	B-Finding
damage	I-Finding
than	O
Zocor.	B-Drug


Before	O
they	O
go	O
to	O
Hell,	O
the	O
people	O
at	O
Pfizer	O
and	O
the	O
doctors	O
who	O
shill	O
for	O
them	O
should	O
be	O
sent	O
to	O
a	O
very	O
nasty	O
prison.	O


Pfizer	O
and	O
its	O
doctor	O
salesmen	O
should	O
be	O
stripped	O
of	O
every	O
asset	O
including	O
their	O
medical	O
licenses.	O


They	O
should	O
be	O
totally	O

The	O

be	O
distributed	O

None	O
for	O
the	O
first	O
5	O

It	O
DID	O
lower	O
my	O

However,	O
in	O
the	O
6th	O
year,	O
I	O
developed	O
terrible	O
ankle/knee/leg/hip	B-ADR
pain,	B-ADR
aching	B-ADR
and	O
soreness.	B-ADR


I	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
muscle	B-ADR
problem.	I-ADR


I	O
got	O
so	O
weak	B-ADR
I	O
had	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
use	I-ADR
a	I-ADR
cane	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
walk.	I-ADR


Then,	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
use	O
the	O
handicapped	O
carts	O
in	O
the	O
grocery	O
store.	O


Then	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
get	O
a	O
handicapped	O
permit	O
because	O
I	O
could	B-ADR
not	I-ADR
walk	I-ADR
more	O
than	O
25	O
steps.	O


I	O
could	B-ADR
not	I-ADR
sleep	I-ADR
for	O
the	O
ache	B-ADR
and	I-ADR
discomfort	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
legs.	I-ADR


I	O
was	O
sure	O
I	O
was	O
a	O
few	O
months	O
away	O
from	O
a	O
wheelchair.	O


I	O
was	O
horribly	O
depressed.	B-ADR


When	O
I	O
asked	O
my	O
doctor	O
about	O
this	O
pain,	B-ADR
he	O
took	O
me	O
off	O
Lipitor,	B-Drug
and	O
within	O
one	O
week	O
my	O
pain	B-ADR
had	O
stopped	O
completely.	O


I	O
can	O
walk	O
fine,	O
I	O
can	O
even	O
run.	O


I	O
sleep	O
like	O
a	O

However,	O
I	O
still	O
cannot	O
walk	O
very	O
far	O
-	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
have	O
lost	O
a	O

I	O
will	O
have	O
to	O
build	O
my	O

Otherwise,	O

EXTREMELY	O

DRUG!	O
I	O
have	O
never	O
had	O
these	O
problems	O
until	O
I	O
started	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


I	O
have	O

it	O
2	O

with	O
now	O
a	O

reduction	O
in	O
side	O

but	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
is	O
still	O
really	O
bad.	O


Does	O
anyone	O

how	O
long	O
it	O
will	O
take	O
for	O
the	O

Lipitor	B-Drug
lowered	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
from	O
268	O
to	O
163	O
but	O
it	O
nearly	O
killed	O
me	O
in	O

It's	O
not	O
worth	O
it.	O


The	O

told	O

I	O
was	O

all	O
this	O

The	O

it's	O

After	O
taking	O

for	O

my	O
muscles	B-ADR

My	O

I	O
can	O

I	O
stopped	O

about	O
a	O

Lipitor	B-Drug

the	O

are	O
too	O
great.	O


First	O
of	O
all,	O
I	O
noticed	O

I	O
put	O
this	O
off	O
as	O
a	O

After	O
the	O

intensified	O
after	O
it	O
should	O
have	O
gone	O
away,	O
I	O
became	O
concerned.	O


Then	O
I	O
noticed	O
that	O
my	O
knee	B-ADR
and	O
my	O
right	O

Then	O
I	O
started	O

I	O

ALl	O
in	O

this	O

I	O

it.	O


I	O

I	O

I	O

so	O
as	O
to	O

my	O

I	O
would	O

my	O

OH	O

you	O

over	O
2	O

after	O

the	O

The	O
side	O
effects	O
came	O
slowly	O
and	O
it	O
took	O
me	O
a	O
while	O
to	O
make	O
the	O
connection.	O


I	O
slowly	O
started	O
experiencing	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
one	O
shoulder	B-ADR

then	O
the	O

Then	O
deep	B-ADR

the	O

the	O

my	I-ADR

started	I-ADR
aching	I-ADR
and	O
insomnia	B-ADR
had	O

I	O
called	O
my	O
doctor	O
who	O
took	O
me	O
off	O
the	O
10	O
mg.	O


dosage.	O


Looking	O
back	O
I	O
realize	O
now	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
symptoms	O
early	O
on	O
but	O
chose	O
to	O
overlook	O
them.	O


Bad	O
choice	O
on	O
my	O
part.	O


I	O
hope	O
now	O
that	O
the	O
9	O
months	O
of	O
taking	O
these	O
meds	O
hasn't	O
caused	O
permanent	O
damage	O
!!.	O


After	O
reading	O
more	O
about	O
the	O
medication	O
I	O
can	O
only	O
say	O
that	O
for	O
me.	O


I	O
am	O
done	O
with	O
taking	O
statins.	O


I	O
will	O
control	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
by	O
losing	O
weight,exercise	O
and	O
diet.	O


It	O
did	O
lower	O
my	O
total	O
cholesterol	O
and	O
my	O
LDL's	O
but	O
the	O
effect	O
it	O
had	O
on	O
my	O
overall	O
well	O
being	O
was	O
too	O
devastating.	O


Two	O
days	O
after	O
starting	O
the	O
lipitor	B-Drug
I	O
felt	O
like	O
my	O
insides	B-ADR
were	I-ADR
vibrating.	I-ADR


I	O
wasn't	O
sure	O
what	O
caused	O
it	O
so	O
continued	O
to	O
take	O
the	O
lipitor.	B-Drug


I	O
began	O
getting	O
very	O
severe	B-ADR
muscle	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	O
my	O
left	O
shoulder,	O
arm	O
and	O
chest	O
area.	O


I	O
was	O
told	O
by	O
the	O
doctor	O
that	O
I	O
probably	O
pulled	O
a	O
muscle.	O


After	O
6	O
weeks	O
of	O
taking	O
lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
constant	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
and	O
twitching	B-ADR
I	O
took	O
myself	O
off	O

I	O
continue	O
to	O
have	O
constant	B-ADR
twitching	I-ADR
and	O
muscle	B-ADR
aches	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
legs	I-ADR
but	O
I've	O
learned	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
it.	O


I've	O
been	O
off	O
of	O
the	O
medication	O
about	O
2	O
months	O
and	O
I'm	O
still	O
waiting	O
for	O
it	O
to	O
improve.	O


I	O
have	O
had	O
several	O
boughts	O
of	O
severe	B-ADR
muscle	I-ADR

that	O
lead	O
to	O

I	O
have	O
had	O
these	O

and	O
Zocor.	B-Drug


There	O
is	O
no	O
way	O
I	O
can	O

I	O
am	O
now	O

the	O
problem	O
and	O
drink	O

I	O
am	O
37	O
and	O
have	O
been	O
on	O

for	O

I	O

I	O

about	O
the	O

and	O
he	O
took	O

It	O

It	O
may	O
have	O
done	O
an	O
excellent	O

of	O
reducing	O

but	O
it	O
is	O
important	O
to	O
have	O
quality	O
of	O
life	O
and	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
have	O
that	O
anymore.	O


I	O
WOULD	O
NEVER	O
TAKE	O
LIPITOR	B-Drug
(or	O
any	O

AGAIN!!!!!.	O


The	O
very	O
first	O
day	O
I	O
took	O
20	O

I	O
experienced	O

By	O
the	O
fifth	O
day	O
I	O
felt	B-ADR
flu-like	I-ADR

very	O
sick.	O


The	O
headache	B-ADR
was	O
constant	O
and	O
only	O
Aleve	B-Drug
slightly	O
helped	O
it.	O


I	O
would	O
sit	O
with	O
a	O
heating	O
pad	O
for	O
hours	O
on	O
my	O
neck.	O


On	O
day	O

I	O

Now	O
I	O

I	O
had	O

the	O

After	O
some	O

off	O

this	O

feeling	O

I	O
tried	O
it	O
again.	O


My	O
back	O
hurt	O
so	O

that	O
I	O
went	O
to	O
a	O

twice	O
and	O
no	O

I	O
thought	O
I	O
might	O
have	O
a	O

decided	O
to	O
go	O
off	O
the	O

again.	O


After	O
two	O

I'm	O
back	O

I	O

I	O

I	O

At	O

I	O

that	O

a	O
severe	B-ADR

almost	O

After	O

I	O
hardly	O
could	O
sleep	O
that	O

As	O
I	O

that	O

I	O
started	O
getting	O
severe	B-ADR
muscle	I-ADR

in	O
the	O

The	O

and	O
gradually	O
the	O

nothing	O

or	O

and	O
realizing	O
that	O
in	O
the	O

the	O

usually	O
were	O
the	O
worst	O
in	O
the	O

got	O

during	O
the	O

and	O
best	O
at	O

just	O
before	O
my	O
Lipitor	B-Drug

I	O
suspected	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


I	O
quit	O
them	O
7	O
days	O

and	O
my	O
back	O
has	O
not	O
been	O
this	O
good	O
in	O
months!.	O


I	O
had	O
been	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
10mg	O
for	O
2	O
years.	O


About	O
6	O
mons.	O


ago,	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
tell	O
my	O
Dr	O
I	O
was	O
having	O
muscle	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
and	O
leg	B-ADR
cramps.	I-ADR


He	O
switched	O
to	O
Pravachol	B-Drug
20mg.	O


I	O
lasted	O
about	O
2	O
weeks.	O


The	O
pain	O
was	O
worse.	O


Then	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
look	O
on	O
the	O
internet	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
what	O
was	O
causing	O
the	O
pain.	O


It	O
was	O
Statin.	O


I	O
looked	O
that	O
up	O
and	O
found	O
what	O
it	O
does	O
to	O
the	O
body.	O


So,	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
any	O
drug	O
and	O
take	O
some	O
Q10	B-Drug
to	O
build	O
my	O
body	O
back	O
up.	O


Two	O
months	O
later	O
went	O
back	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
with	O
the	O
Q10.	B-Drug


2	O
months	O
later,	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
was	O
back.	O


Twice	O
as	O
bad	O
as	O
before,	O
plus	O
a	O
whole	O
bunch	O
of	O
other	O
side	O
effects,	O
you	O
see	O
I'm	O
seriuosly	O
allergic	O
to	O
the	O
Statin.	O


And	O
I	O
know	O
now,	O
why	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
known	O
this,	O
but	O
no	O
one	O
told	O
me	O
about	O
it.	O


When	O
you	O
are	O
taking	O
Statin	O
and	O
drink	O
alcohol	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
increase	O
dramatically.	O


When	O
ever	O
I	O
drank,	O
sipped	O
a	O
little	O
wine,	O
by	O
body	O
hurt	O
so	O
bad,	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O
the	O
flu.	O


And	O
no	O
Aleve,	B-Drug
or	O
pain	O
killer	O
would	O
help.	O


I	O
thought	O
I	O
was	O
allergic	O
to	O
the	O
alcohol.	O


But	O
now	O
I	O
know	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
Statin.	O


Here	O
are	O
a	O
list	O
of	O
the	O
side-effects	O
I	O
had,	O
that	O
started	O
slowly	O
and	O
in	O
two	O
years,	O
became	O
unbearable:	O
Insomina,abnoraml	B-ADR

During	O
the	O
two	O
years,	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
the	O
Lipitor,	B-Drug
all	O
these	O
syptoms	O
started	O
out	O
slowly.	O


First	O
came	O
the	O
tinnitus.	B-ADR


My	O
Dr	O
sent	O
me	O
to	O
the	O
ear	O
Dr.	O


Found	O
no	O
problem,	O
I	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
live	O
with	O
it.	O


Second,	O
came	O
depression,	O
Dr	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
Zoloft.	B-Drug


Then	O
came	O
the	O
sinus	O
problems,	O
Dr	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
Rhinocort.	B-Drug


During	O
all	O
this	O
I	O
felt	O
like	O
I	O
was	O
80	O
years	O
old.	O


My	O
neck	B-ADR
hurt,	I-ADR
my	O
hips	B-ADR
hurt.	I-ADR


We	O
got	O
a	O
$3,000.00	O
sleep	O
by	O
number	O
bed	O
to	O
relieve	O
the	O
pain.	B-ADR


Didn't	O
really	O
help.	O


Insomia	B-ADR
was	O
constant.	O


I	O
got	O
hooked	O
on	O
Tylenol	B-Drug
PM.	I-Drug


I	O
gained	B-ADR
a	I-ADR
lot	I-ADR
of	I-ADR
weight.	I-ADR


Went	O
to	O
Lindora	O
to	O
loss	O
weight,	O
so	O
I	O
could	O
get	O
off	O
the	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


Lost	O
40	O
lbs.	O


Dr	O
said	O
to	O
stay	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
prevention.	O


This	O
is	O
when	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
check	O
it	O
out	O
on	O
the	O
internet.	O


When	O
I	O
went	O
back	O
on	O
the	O
Lipitor,	B-Drug
about	O
2	O
months	O
ago,	O
I	O
had	O
a	O
small	O
drink	O
of	O
wine	O
at	O
a	O
wedding.	O


That	O
night	O
my	O
body	O
aches	O
were	O
so	O
bad,	O
I	O
could	O
hardly	O
stand	O
it.	O


Then	O
two	O
days	O
later	O
I	O
came	O
down	O
with	O
bronhitis,	B-Finding
and	O
asthma.	B-Finding


I	O
have	O
asthma	B-Finding
anyway,	O
but	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
worse	O
case	O
I've	O
had	O
in	O
13	O
years.	O


Then	O
I	O
had	O
sinus	B-ADR
problems	I-ADR
again.	O


My	O
Dr	O
took	O
x-rays	O
for	O
pneumonia	B-Finding
and	O
sinus	B-Finding
infection,	I-Finding
Came	O
back	O
clear.	O


My	O
Dr	O
wanted	O
me	O
to	O
see	O
an	O
ear	O
nose	O
and	O
throat	O
Dr	O
Then	O
my	O
blood	O
pressure	O
went	O
up	O
to	O
198/90.	O


I	O
have	O
never	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
had	O
high	B-ADR
blood	I-ADR
pressure.	I-ADR


Dr	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
Norvasc.	B-Drug


Then	O
I	O
had	O
two	O
horrible	O
nightmares.	B-ADR


I	O
finally,	O
went	O
on	O
the	O
internet	O
and	O
looked	O
at	O
side	O
effects	O
for	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


When	O
I	O
saw	O
all	O
the	O
side-effects,	O
I	O
nearly	O
died.	O


I	O
have	O
all	O
the	O
syptoms.	O


I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
that	O
instant.	O


That	O
was	O
one	O
week	O
ago.	O


I'm	O
starting	O
feel	O
a	O
little	O
better.	O


I've	O
gone	O
to	O
my	O
Dr	O
and	O
asked	O
him	O
if	O
he	O
new	O
about	O
the	O
alcohol	O
related	O
problem.	O


He	O
said,	O
no.	O


There	O
is	O
no	O
warning	O
on	O
the	O
prescription	O
bottle,	O
to	O
tell	O
you	O
to	O
watch	O
out	O
for	O
a	O
reaction	O
with	O
alcohol.	O


The	O
Dr	O
is	O
now	O
doing	O
tests,	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
there	O
has	O
been	O
any	O
damage	O
to	O
my	O
heart	O
and	O
muscles.	O


I	O
also,	O
asked	O
for	O
physical	O
theraphy	O
for	O
my	O
left	O
shoulder	O
and	O
neck.	O


My	O
left	B-ADR
shoulder	I-ADR
is	I-ADR
almost	I-ADR
immobile.	I-ADR


I	O
think	O
the	O
tinnitus	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
left	I-ADR
ear	I-ADR
has	O
been	O
caused	O
by	O
the	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


I	O
hope	O
it	O
goes	O
away	O
soon.	O


I	O
also,	O
lost	B-ADR
my	I-ADR
sense	I-ADR
of	I-ADR
taste	I-ADR
during	O
this	O
whole	O
thing.	O


I	O
would	O
recommend	O
anyone	O
who	O
has	O
experienced	O
any	O
side	O
effects	O
increased	O
by	O
alcohol,	O
to	O
consider	O
an	O
allergic	O
reaction	O
to	O
the	O
drug.	O


Dr	O
was	O
thinking	O
about	O
putting	O
on	O
another	O
Statin	O
drug.	O


I	O
said,	O
don't	O
you	O
get	O
it,	O
I'm	O
allergic	O
to	O
it.	O


.	O


Does	O
not	O
appear	O
to	O
be	O
giving	O
me	O
negative	O

My	O

began	O
with	O

long	O
before	O
my	O

any	O

by	O
reading	O

I	O

that	O

My	O
doctor	O
suggested	O
going	O
off	O
lipitor	B-Drug
as	O
of	O
today	O
to	O
see	O
if	O
that	O
is	O
the	O
culprit.	O


I	O
will	O
post	O
another	O
message	O
when	O
I	O
stay	O
off	O
of	O
it	O
for	O
awhile.	O


I	O
really	O
do	O
believe	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
though,	O
as	O
I	O
had	O
never	O
had	O
problems	O
prior	O
to	O
being	O
put	O
on	O
that	O
particular	O
medicine.	O


Doctor	O
gave	O
me	O
a	O
prescription	O
for	O
a	O
year's	O
worth	O
of	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


I	O
took	O
it	O
for	O
four	O
months	O
and	O
asked	O
for	O
a	O
retest	O
before	O
renewing	O
my	O
prescription.	O


In	O
four	O
months,	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
dropped	O
100	O
points,	O
HDL	O
and	O
LDL	O
were	O
in	O
better,	O
though	O
not	O
perfect	O
balance.	O


With	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
at	O
139,	O
I	O
declined	O
to	O
take	O
more	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


Got	O
HDL	O
and	O
LDL	O
into	O
perfect	O
balance	O
within	O
another	O
two	O
months	O
using	O
certain	O
over-the-counter	O
amino	O
acids,	O
tocotrienols,	O
and	O
other	O
nutrients	O
I	O
found	O
online	O
that	O
supposedly	O
do	O
the	O
job.	O


They	O
do!	O
And	O
the	O
nice	O
thing	O
is,	O
if	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
goes	O
up	O
again,	O
I	O
know	O
that	O
very	O
low	O
dose	O
of	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
will	O
take	O
care	O
of	O
it.	O


Good	O
stuff!.	O


Lipitor	B-Drug

BEWARE.	O


Lipitor	B-Drug
reduced	O
my	O
readings	O
to	O
almost	O
normal.	O


At	O
the	O
same	O
time	O
I	O
suffered	O
from	O
fibromyalgia.	B-Finding


The	O
pain	B-ADR
all	I-ADR
over	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
body	I-ADR
got	O
worse	O
as	O
time	O
went	O
on.	O


I	O
noticed	O
that	O
when	O
I	O
left	O
my	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
at	O
home	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
on	O
vacation	O
or	O
other	O
trip,	O
that	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
feel	O
better.	O


My	O
doctor	O
told	O
me	O
there	O
was	O
a	O
remote	O
possibility	O
that	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
was	O
agravating	O
the	O
fibromyalgia.	B-Finding


I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
feel	O
so	O
much	O
better!	O
But,	O
it	O
seems	O
I	O
buggered	O
up	O
my	O

from	O
all	O
the	O

that	O
I	O

What	O

Please	O

After	O

it	O
a	O
month	O

and	O
its	O
about	O
50%	O

already.	O


muscle	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
side	O
effects	O
seem	O
much	O
more	O
common	O
than	O
realized	O
by	O

or	O
admitted	O
by	O
the	O
company.	O


On	O
lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
4	O

Reduced	O

BUT	O
since	O
taking	O

I've	O
developed	O
horrible	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
both	B-ADR
shoulders	I-ADR
and	O
left	B-ADR
knee.	I-ADR


Sleeping	O
has	O
become	O
extemely	O
difficult	O
due	O
to	O
pain.	O


Have	O
to	O
sleep	O
in	O
a	O
chair	O
most	O
nights.	O


Orthopedist	O
seems	O
to	O
think	O
its	O
normal	O
aging	O
(I'm	O
only	O
55)	O
and	O
internist	O
is	O
skeptical	O
that	O
lipitor	B-Drug
is	O
the	O
culprit.	O


I	O
have	O
also	O
noticed	O
that	O
I	O
have	O
short	B-ADR
term	I-ADR
memory	I-ADR
loss	I-ADR
and	O
am	O
easily	B-ADR
fatigued.	I-ADR


After	O
reading	O
the	O
entries	O
on	O
this	O
site	O
I'm	O
stopping	O
the	O
lipitor	B-Drug
today	O
and	O
we'll	O
see	O
the	O
result.	O


After	O
a	O
routine	O
check	O
up	O
my	O
cholesterol	B-Finding
level	I-Finding
was	O
found	O
to	O
be	O
sky	B-Finding
high.	I-Finding


So	O
two	O
months	O
ago	O
the	O
internist	O
put	O
me	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
high	B-Finding
cholesterol.	I-Finding


The	O
lipitor	B-Drug
helped	O
in	O
reducing	O
the	O
cholesterol	O
level	O
by	O
20%.	O


The	O
side	O
effects	O
were	O
terrible!	O
I	O
had	O
for	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
years	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
hipjoints.	I-ADR


The	O
lipitor	B-Drug
increased	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
tenfold.	O


I	O
could	O
hardly	O
walk,	O
sit	O
or	O
drive	O
the	O
car.	O


The	O
pain	B-ADR
I	O
was	O
experiencing	O
especially	O
around	B-ADR
the	I-ADR
hipjoints	I-ADR
was	O
incredible.	O


I	O
told	O
the	O
specialist	O
about	O
these	O
side-effects	O
and	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
to	O
reduce	O
the	O
dose	O
from	O
1	O
a	O
day	O
to	O
1	O
every	O
two	O
days!?	O
I	O
had	O
already	O
stopped	O
taking	O
the	O
lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
a	O
week	O
and	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
had	O
decreased	O
somewhat.	O


I	O
learned	O
from	O
the	O
pharmacist	O
that	O
this	O
drug	O
can	O
cause	O
wasting	B-Finding
of	I-Finding
muscles	I-Finding
and	O
that	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
to	O
end	O
up	O
in	O
a	O
wheelchair	O
because	O
of	O
it!!	O
I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O

alternative	O
medicines.	O


I	O

This	O
drug	O
is	O
a	O
nightmare	O
and	O
should	O
be	O
discontinued.	O


I	O
had	O
my	O
first	O
child	O
at	O
34	O
and	O
my	O
husband	O
and	O
I	O
wanted	O
a	O
second	O
one	O
badly.	O


Because	O
of	O
all	O
the	O
medical	O
issues	O
this	O
had	O
to	O
be	O

Meanwhile	O
my	O

lost	O
his	O

and	O
we	O
had	O
to	O
apply	O
for	O
insurance	O

-	O
I	O

to	O

an	O

until	O
I	O
was	O
put	O
on	O
this	O
medication.	O


After	O
taking	O
it	O
for	O
3-4	O
months	O
I	O
had	O
terrible	B-ADR
pains	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
knee,	B-ADR
ankle,	B-ADR
big	B-ADR
toe.	I-ADR


Couldn't	B-ADR
walk	B-ADR
or	O
even	O
sleep	B-ADR

I	O
thought	O
I	O
had	O
gout,	B-Finding
which	O
runs	O
in	O
my	O
family.	O


HMO	O
doctors	O
said	O
not	O
gout,	B-Finding
but	O
didn't	O
know	O
what.	O


I	O
finally	O
stumbled	O
on	O
this	O
web	O
site,	O
and	O
thought	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


I	O
stopped	O
taking	O
it	O
and	O
immediately	O
got	O
some	O
relief.	O


That	O
was	O
a	O
month	O
and	O
a	O
half	O
ago.	O


Still	O
have	O
some	O
pain	B-ADR
and	O
other	O

(eg.	I-ADR

in	I-ADR

joints,	I-ADR
but	O
it	O
is	O
gradually	O
getting	O
less.	O


This	O
drug	O
is	O
too	O
dangerous	O
to	O
use.	O


We	O
need	O
something	O
with	O
the	O
same	O
good	O
effects,	O
but	O
not	O
the	O

in	I-ADR
knee	B-ADR

foot.	B-ADR


Terrible	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR

After	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
a	O
year,	O
I	O
started	O
having	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
hip.	I-ADR


Told	O
Dr	O
about	O
it,	O
he	O
didn't	O
seem	O
to	O
concerned.	O


After	O
about	O
1	O
1/2	O
years	O
I	O
started	O
having	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
shoulders.	I-ADR


The	O
pain	B-ADR
is	O
so	O
bad	B-ADR
at	O
this	O
point	O
that	O
it	O
wakes	O
me	O
up	O
at	O
night	O
and	O
extremely	B-ADR
limits	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
use	I-ADR
of	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

Dr	O
sent	O
me	O
for	O
x-rays,	O

to	O
see	O
an	O
orthopedic	O
surgeon.	O


All	O
results	O
negative.	O


They	O
suggested	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
tendonitis	B-Finding
or	O
avascular	B-Finding
necrosis	I-Finding
and	O
recommended	O
anti-inflammatories.	O


Nobody	O
ever	O
suggested	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
the	O
drug	O
until	O
I	O
found	O
this	O
site	O
doing	O
research	O
on	O
my	O
pain.	B-ADR


It	O
makes	O
me	O
wonder	O
how	O
powerful	O
these	O
drug	O
companies	O
are	O
that	O
doctors	O
won't	O
even	O
suggest	O
that	O
the	O
drug	O
could	O
be	O
the	O
problem.	O


I'm	O
stopping	O
this	O
drug	O
today	O
in	O
the	O
hopes	O
that	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
goes	O
away.	O


Hopefully	O
I'll	O
be	O
able	O
to	O
play	O
catch	O
with	O
my	O
boys	O
and	O
swing	O
a	O

of	O
a	O

attack	I-Finding
from	O
high	B-Finding
cholesteral	I-Finding
in	O
20	O

so	O
be	O
it.	O


I'd	O
rather	O
have	O
a	O
shorter	O
life	O
that	O
I	O
enjoy	O
than	O
a	O

life	O

but	O
if	O
the	O
side	O

I	O
would	O
have	O
to	O
decide	O
if	O

I	O

extreme	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
and	O
loss	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
muscle	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
left	I-ADR

Advice	O
from	O
Cardiologist	O
was	O
to	O
immediately	O
stop	O
taking	O
Liptitor.	B-Drug


It	O
was	O
too	O
late,	O
resulting	O
in	O
the	O
loss	O
of	O
being	O
able	O
to	O
work	O
and	O
ended	O
up	O
disabitlity	O
and	O
would	O
like	O
to	O
join	O
a	O
class	O
action	O
lawsuit	O
against	O
the	O
drug	O
company	O
responsible.	O


Would	O
like	O
to	O
hear	O
from	O
others	O
who	O
have	O
had	O
problems	O
with	O
this	O
drug.	O


No	O
noticeable	O
side	O
effects.	O


Lowered	O
cholesterol	O
and	O
triglycerides	O
.	O


Back	B-ADR
pain,	I-ADR
Lipitor	B-Drug
seems	O
to	O
be	O
involved.	O


In	O
November	O
of	O
2005	O
I	O
was	O
prescribed	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
elevated	B-Finding
cholesterol.	I-Finding


Not	O
really	O
high,	O
but	O
high	O
enough,	O
dosage	O
was	O
only	O
20	O
mg	O
per	O
day.	O


Within	O
two	O
months,	O
I	O
had	O
developed	O
wicked	B-ADR
back	I-ADR
pain,	I-ADR
along	O
with	O
neuropathy	B-ADR
and	O
hypersensitivity	B-ADR
that	I-ADR
wrapped	I-ADR
around	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
abdomen.	I-ADR


We	O
suspected	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
was	O
involved,	O
so	O
I	O
went	O
off	O
it,	O
since	O
my	O
numbers	O
had	O
gotten	O
really	O
low.	O


I	O
was	O
effectively	O
laid	O
up	O
for	O
about	O
six	O
months.	O


Since	O
there	O
was	O
no	O
immediate	O
improvement,	O
we	O
surmised	O
that	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
wasn't	O
causing	O
this.	O


It's	O
October	O
2006	O
now,	O
and	O
I'm	O
starting	O
to	O
feel	O
more	O
like	O
myself,	O
still	O
hurts	O
but	O
I	O
can	O
work	O
around	O
it.	O


The	O
cholesterol	O
has	O
crept	O
up,	O
so	O
two	O
weeks	O
ago	O
we	O
started	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
again,	O
and	O
within	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
I	O
was	O
paractically	O
flat	O
on	O
my	O
back	O
again!	O
So,	O
I've	O
stopped	O
again.	O


It's	O
a	O
bloody	O
shame	O
this	O
is	O
happening,	O
as	O
the	O
drug	O
was	O
extremely	O
effective	O
in	O
dropping	O
that	O
cholesterol.	O


Too	O
bad,	O
we're	O
going	O
to	O
have	O
to	O
try	O
something	O
else,	O
I	O
guess.	O


I	O
have	O
been	O
taking	O

I	O

Lipitor	B-Drug
in	O
1996	O

I	O

over	O

I	O

considered	O

until	O

I	O

test,	O
including	O
a	O
1.5	O

every	O

because	O
I'm	O
in	O
the	O

I	O
took	O

off	O

because	O
I	O
can	O
not	O
take	O
the	O

In	O

I	O
need	O

I	O

I	O
was	O

that	O
has	O
not	O
helped	O
my	O

I	O
walked	O

4	O

I	O

with	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

I've	O

Two	O

I	O

my	O

a	O

It's	O

I	O

Thank	O

I	O

Sure,	O
it	O
lowered	O
my	O

it	O

Neurologist	O

Shortly	O

I	O

my	O

I	O
blamed	O
it	O

(with	O
a	O

with	O
my	O

which	O
he	O
attributed	O

I	O
even	O
had	O
tests	O

that	O
could	O
be	O
the	O

as	O
I	O

an	O
aortic	B-Finding

and	O
thought	O

my	O

damaging	B-ADR
my	I-ADR

following	O

It	O

249	O
and	O
counting.	O


No	O
side	O

This	O
could	O

Constant	B-ADR

Had	O
no	O
idea	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
caused	O
by	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
until	O
I	O
found	O
this	O
website	O
and	O
others	O
who	O
have	O
the	O
exact	O
same	O
symptoms.	O


Thank	O
you	O
for	O
this	O
website.	O


I	O
took	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
8	O
weeks	O
and	O
experienced	O
extreme	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
all	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

It	O
has	O
brought	O
me	O
to	O

and	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
to	O
use	O

My	O

me	O

and	O
all	O

came	O
back	O
normal	O

thank	O
goodness	O
she	O
took	O
me	O
off	O
the	O

I	O
would	O
not	O

this	O

Other	O
than	O
mild	B-ADR

and	O
things	O
of	O
this	O
nature,	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
connect	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
to	O
the	O
terrible	O
low	B-ADR
back	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
I	O
have	O
had	O
for	O
about	O
5	O
months.	O


but	O
after	O
reading	O
comments	O
on	O
this	O
website,	O
I	O
am	O
wondering	O
about	O
this	O
back	B-ADR
and	O
neck	B-ADR
pain	B-ADR
that	O
worsens.	O


It	O
is	O
a	O
miracle	O
drug	O
along	O
with	O
Vitamin	B-Drug
E	I-Drug
and	O
additional	O
Premarin.	B-Drug


My	O
cholesterol	O
was	O
over	O
600	O
a	O
number	O
of	O
years	O
back.	O


I've	O
tried	O
at	O
least	O
5	O
other	O
meds	O
for	O
this	O
condition	O
but	O
this	O
one	O
is	O
most	O
effective.	O


The	O
lowest	O
the	O
other	O
ones	O
took	O
it	O
was	O
to	O
300.	O


My	O
endocrinologist	O
thought	O
this	O
was	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
best	O
it	O
could	O
be	O
controlled.	O


So,	O
I	O
really	O
believe	O
in	O
this	O
drug,	O
but	O
must	O
consider	O
what	O
it	O
may	O
be	O
doing	O
to	O
my	O
body	O
and	O
my	O
degree	O
of	O
pain.	B-ADR


I	O

the	O

This	O

Since	O

out	O

I've	O
only	O

on	O

I've	O
also	O
had	O

that	O
any	O

you	O
go	O

it	O
could	O

It's	O
just	O
that	O
my	O
last	O
one	O
was	O
high	O
(275!)	O
But	O
sometimes	O
it's	O
170.	O


And	O
it's	O
also	O
been	O
borderline	O
for	O
many	O
years,	O
around	O
200.	O


(with	O
the	O
good	O
cholesterol	O
very	O
good).	O


I	O
think	O
it's	O
higher	O
these	O
days,	O
because	O
I've	O
been	O
in	O
menopause	B-Finding
longer.	O


But	O
I	O
wonder	O
if	O
side	O
effects	O
to	O
any	O
drug	O
aren't	O
a	O
message	O
that.	O


This	O
is	O
the	O

On	O

The	O
next	O
day,	O
I	O
felt	O

in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

I	O
thought	O
I	O

I	O

the	O

vanished	O
after	O
a	O
little	O
more	O
than	O
a	O
day.	O


I	O
started	O

an	O

in	I-ADR
the	I-ADR

Next	O
the	O
calf	B-ADR
sensation	I-ADR
turned	I-ADR
painful	I-ADR
at	O
night	O
and	O
started	O
increasing.	O


I	O
figured	O
out	O
these	O
issues	O
all	O
might	O
be	O
caused	O
by	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
stopped	O

it	O
immediately.	O


But	O
the	O

my	I-ADR

continued	O

I	O
did	O
not	O
take	O
the	O

I	O

I	O
attribute	O
the	O

the	O
Lipitor,	B-Drug

there	O

I	O

Apparently,	O
some	O
(a	O

I	O
note	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
on	O

but	O
when	O
I	O
quit	O

I	O
got	O

gradually.	O


I	O
really	O
had	O
to	O

my	O

to	O
get	O
him	O
to	O
believe	O
that	O

was	O

this.	O

put	O

I	O

on	O
Pravachol	B-Drug
for	O
aboout	O
3	O
years	O
and	O
switched	O
to	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
because	O
it's	O
supposed	O
to	O
lower	O

I	O
had	O
the	O

already	O

was	O
told	O
it	O
was	O
arthritis	B-Finding

(I'm	O
also	O
a	O

My	O

(dad-57,	O

but	O
if	O
this	O
is	O
what	O
is	O
causing	O
this	O

I	O
think	O
I	O
would	O
rather	O
die	O

this.	O


I	O

I	O

a	O

on	O

maybe	O
I	O
should	O
just	O
quit	O

this	O

after	O

I	O

data	O
with	O
this	O
class	O
of	O
drug	O

and	O
I	O
think	O
I'll	O
keep	O
taking	O
it	O
for	O
the	O
long-term	O
benefits.	O


After	O
being	O
on	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
only	O
two	O
months,	O
I	O
was	O
experiencing	O
debilitating	B-ADR
muscle	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
arms,	B-ADR

and	O

Additionally,	O
I	O
was	O
experiencing	O
severe	B-ADR

in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

The	O
good	O
news	O
was	O
that	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
dropped	O
from	O
269	O
to	O
160.	O


The	O
bad	O
news	O
was	O
that	O
long	O
term,	O
it	O
would	O
likely	O
impact	O
the	O
heart	O

Once	O
the	O

saw	O
the	O

on	O
my	O

test,	O
he	O
called	O
(himself)	O
and	O
said	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
immediately.	O


Interestingly,	O
Niaspan	B-Drug
had	O
the	O

I'm	O

my	O

they	O
didn't	O

I	O

I	O

I	O

in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

but	O
not	O

I	O
just	O
wish	O
the	O

would	O
tell	O
you	O
about	O
the	O

but	O
after	O

my	O
rheumatologist	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
not	O
gout!	B-Finding
I	O
have	O
an	O
appt.	O


scheduled	O
to	O
start	O
to	O
deal	O
with	O
this	O
pain	B-ADR
but	O
an	O
experience	O
last	O
night	O
and	O
reading	O
some	O
postings	O
on	O
this	O
site	O
are	O
leading	O
me	O
to	O
suspect	O
the	O
lipitor.	B-Drug


My	O
usual	O
20mg	O
dose	O
is	O
taken	O
with	O
dinner,	O
but	O
I	O
had	O
forgotten	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
and	O
remembered	O
just	O
before	O
bedtime.	O


I	O
awoke	O
at	O
3AM	O
with	O
an	O
a	O
knee	B-ADR
that	O
was	O
just	O
throbbing	B-ADR
with	I-ADR
pain.	I-ADR


I	O
hobbled	O
to	O
the	O
bathroom	O
and	O
took	O
a	O
dose	O
of	O
Advil	B-Drug
and	O
was	O
able	O
to	O
get	O
back	O
to	O
sleep	O
after	O
about	O
a	O
half	O
hour.	O


I	O
awoke	O
this	O
morning	O
with	O
about	O
a	O
50%	O
reduction	O
in	O
pain	B-ADR
and	O
it	O
seems	O
to	O
have	O
subsided	O
as	O
the	O
day	O
goes	O
on.	O


I	O
will	O
never	O
take	O
lipitor	B-Drug
before	O
bed	O
again,	O
I	O
may	O
cut	O
the	O
daily	O
dose	O
in	O
half	O
and	O
possibly	O
stop	O
altogether	O
if	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
persists	O
at	O
an	O
intolerable	O
level.	O


Lipitor	B-Drug
has	O
lowered	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
levels	O
to	O
the	O
180's.	O


I	O
had	O
never	O
had	O
a	O
reading	O
below	O
218	O
in	O
my	O
life	O
and	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
steadily	O
rising	O
over	O
the	O
last	O
few	O
years	O
to	O
a	O
consistent	O
level	O
in	O
the	O
240's.	O


The	O
ratio	O
of	O
bad	O
to	O
good	O
cholesterol	O
is	O
in	O
the	O
acceptable	O
zone	O
and	O
never	O
had	O
been	O
before	O
taking	O
lipitor.	B-Drug


So,	O
all	O
in	O
all,	O
the	O
lipitor	B-Drug
has	O
done	O
a	O
good	O
job.	O


I	O
will	O
try	O
to	O
cope	O
with	O
the	O
joint	B-ADR
pain,	I-ADR
but	O
if	O
it	O
becomes	O
a	O
constant	O
problem,	O
I	O
will	O
have	O
to	O

the	O

drug	O
I	O
take	O

have	O
taken	O
it	O
for	O
four	O

even	O

I	O

then	O
I	O
rarely	B-Finding
sleep	I-Finding

since	O
I	O
went	O
through	O

ten	O

I	O
think	O
some	O
of	O
my	O

are	O
related	O
to	O
being	O
post	O

rather	O
than	O
from	O
the	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


After	O
4+	O

I've	O

to	O
experience	O

It	O
has	O

nearly	O
2	O

since	O
the	O

I	O
am	O
truly	O
concerned	O
about	O
any	O
permanent	O
damage	O
this	O
medication	O
my	O

caused.	O


After	O
only	O
3	O
10mg	O
doses	O
I	O
have	O
suffered	O
a	O
month	O
of	O
side	O
effects!	O
I	O
wouldn't	O
recommend	O
this	O
to	O
anyone!	O
If	O
you	O
are	O
taking	O
it	O
now	O
and	O
experience	O
anything	O
unusual	O
at	O
all,	O
contact	O
your	O
doctor	O
immediately!	O
I	O
feared	O
I	O
might	O
be	O
over	O
reacting	O
to	O
the	O
muscle	B-ADR
ache!	I-ADR
I	O
don't	O
know	O
where	O
I'd	O
be	O
if	O
I	O
had	O
continued	O
taking	O
lipitor	B-Drug
beyond	O
the	O
3	O
days!!!.	O


Not	O
much	O
--	O
occasional	O
itchiness.	B-ADR


I	O
was	O
taking	O
Red	B-Drug
Yeast	I-Drug
statins	O
for	O
chlolesterol	O
of	O
230,	O
but	O
then	O
big-pharma	O
got	O
in	O
the	O
picture	O
and	O
made	O
that	O
illegal.	O


Don't	O
know	O
if	O
that	O
is	O
still	O
the	O
case.	O


My	O
doctor	O
said	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
was	O
the	O
most	O
tested	O
statin	O
drug.	O


My	O
real	O
concern	O
is	O
heart	B-Disease
disease	I-Disease
which	O
is	O
in	O
my	O
family.	O


Not	O
sure	O
of	O
how	O
tight	O
the	O
correlation	O
is	O
between	O
low	O
chlosterol	O
numbers	O
and	O
low	O
risk	O
of	O
coronary	B-Disease
problems.	I-Disease


AMA	O
dumbs	O
down	O
the	O
information	O
to	O
make	O
is	O
sound	O
like	O
getting	O
down	O
to	O
ridiculous	O
levels	O
(100)	O
insures	O
that	O
you	O
won't	O
have	O
problems.	O


I	O
doubt	O
it.	O


Probably	O
much	O
more	O
based	O
on	O
genetic	O
history.	O


So	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
is	O
great	O
for	O
reducing	O
your	O
numbers,	O
but	O
extending	O
your	O

???.	O

I	O
was	O
put	O
on	O
this	O
drug	O
by	O
my	O
doctor	O
for	O
my	O
somewhat	O
high	B-Finding
cholesterol.	I-Finding


The	O
next	O
day,	O
after	O
starting	O
this	O
drug,	O
I	O
suddenly	O
felt	B-ADR
like	I-ADR
I	I-ADR
had	I-ADR
aged	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
eighty	I-ADR
years	I-ADR
old	I-ADR
overnight	I-ADR
but	O
did	O
not	O
connect	O
it	O
to	O
starting	O
Lipitor.	B-Drug


Up	O
until	O
the	O
start	O
of	O
this	O
drug	O
I	O
felt	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
as	O
young	O
as	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
my	O
twenties	O
and	O
wondered	O
if	O
this	O
is	O
how	O
you	O
might	O
start	O
feeling	O
the	O
affects	O
of	O
age,	O
by	O
waking	O
up	O
one	O
morning	O
and	O
feeling	B-ADR
all	I-ADR
that	I-ADR
age	I-ADR
caught	I-ADR
up	I-ADR
with	I-ADR
you	I-ADR
and	O
now	O
you	O
were	O
older	O
than	O
your	O
years.	O


I	O
took	O
the	O
drug	O
for	O
two	O
terrible	O
months	O
and	O
then	O
had	O
a	O
blood	O
test	O
and	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
had	O
dropped.	O


My	O
doctor	O
mailed	O
me	O
the	O
results	O
of	O
my	O
blood	O
test	O
but	O
did	O
not	O
send	O
me	O
a	O
new	O
prescription	O
like	O
he	O
had	O
the	O
last	O
time	O
so	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
he	O
wanted	O
me	O
to	O
get	O
it	O
refilled.	O


So	O
I	O
went	O
off	O
of	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
within	O
two	O
months	O
I	O
was	O
feeling	O
normal	O
again	O
and	O
even	O
took	O
a	O
job	O
with	O
the	O
post	O
office	O
where	O
I	O
walked	O
five	O
miles	O
a	O
day	O
with	O
no	O
problem.	O


I	O
did	O
not	O
associate	O
my	O
getting	O
better	O
with	O
my	O
coming	O
off	O
Lipitor,	B-Drug
unfortunately.	O


Then	O
I	O
had	O
an	O
appointment	O
with	O
my	O
doctor	O
and	O
he	O
said	O
I	O
should	O
have	O
refilled	O
that	O
prescription	O
by	O
calling	O
his	O
office.	O


So	O
I	O
did	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
day,	O
after	O
taking	O
only	O
one	O
pill,	O
I	B-ADR
was	I-ADR
eighty	I-ADR
years	I-ADR
old	I-ADR
again.	O


This	O
time	O
I	O
did	O
associate	O
it	O
with	O
the	O
start	O
of	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
then	O
read	O
the	O
warnings	O
the	O
drug	O
store	O
gives	O
you	O
with	O
meds	O
and	O
found	O
that	O
my	O
symptoms	O
were	O
the	O
same	O
as	O
what	O
they	O
warned	O
against.	O


I	O
am	O
not	O
a	O
hypochondriac	B-Finding
and	O
I	O
never	O
read	O
those	O
warnings	O
so	O
this	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
head	O
thing.	O


I	O
immediately	O
went	O
off	O
the	O
drug	O
but	O
a	O
year	O
later	O
I	O
am	O
still	O
have	O
the	O
same	O
eighty	B-ADR
years	I-ADR
old	I-ADR
feeling	I-ADR
and	O
do	O
not	O
know	O
that	O
I	O
will	O
ever	O
be	O
normal	O
again.	O


I	O
do	O
not	O
understand	O
how	O
just	O
one	O
pill	O
can	O
do	O
that	O
and	O
this	O
time	O
I	O
am	O
not	O
recovering	O
like	O
I	O
did	O
the	O
first	O
time.	O


This	O
has	O
ruined	O
my	O
life	O
and	O
I	O
would	O
never	O
have	O
taken	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
if	O
I	O
knew	O
what	O
I	O
know	O
now	O
and	O
I	O
am	O
so	O
sorry	O
that	O
I	O
ever	O
heard	O
of	O
this	O
drug.	O


This	O
is	O
so	O
severe	O
that	O
I	O
think	O
taking	O
it	O
for	O
even	O
a	O
short	O
time	O
can	O
cause	O
permanent	O
damage.	O


My	O
doctor,	O
when	O
I	O
told	O
him	O
of	O
all	O
this,	O
wanted	O
to	O
change	O
statins	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
still	O
worried	O
about	O
my	O
cholesterol.	O


I	O
told	O
him	O
no	O
more	O
statins	O
and	O
he	O
then	O
prescribed	O
Zetia,	B-Drug
which	O
he	O
said	O
was	O
was	O
less	O
effective	O
but	O
was	O
not	O
a	O
statin,	O
which	O
I	O
am	O
still	O

due	O

genetically	B-Finding
high	I-Finding

for	O
a	O
period	O
of	O
seven	O

At	O
that	O
point,	O
I	O
started	O
having	O
terrible,	B-ADR
migratory	I-ADR
joint	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
all	I-ADR
over	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
body	I-ADR
that	O
was	O
very	O
distinct	O
and	O
pronounced.	O


I	O
also	O
had	O
disabling	B-ADR
fatigue	I-ADR
and	O
flu-like	B-ADR
malaise.	I-ADR


Some	O
nights	O
I	O
would	O
go	O

at	O
6	O
pm	O
and	O
not	O
get	O
up	O
until	O
8	O
or	O
9	O
the	O
next	O
morning.	O


I	O
was	O
quite	B-ADR
ill.	I-ADR


My	O
doctor	O
did	O
tons	O
of	O
lab	O
work	O
to	O
rule	O
out	O
things	O
like	O
rheumatoid	B-Finding

These	O
all	O
came	O

NEGATIVE.	O


Finally,	O
I	O
was	O
taken	O
off	O

to	O
see	O
if	O
the	O
drug	O
had	O
anything	O
to	O
do	O
with	O
my	O
symptoms.	O


Within	O
72	O
hours	O
I	O
noted	O
an	O
improvement;	O
within	O
seven	O
days,	O
the	O
symptoms	O
were	O
completely	O
gone	O
and	O
I	O
was	O
restored	O
to	O
health.	O


I	O
will	O
not	O
ever	O
take	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
again	O
as	O
I	O
believe	O
it	O
is	O
liver-toxic	O
and	O
slowly	O
poisons	O
the	O
patient.	O


It	O
did	O
a	O
great	O
job	O
of	O
lowering	O
my	O
LDL	O
(173	O
down	O
to	O
60).	O


My	O
total	O
cholesterol	O
went	O
from	O
238	O
down	O
to	O
143.	O


However,	O
it	O
nearly	O
killed	O
me	O
in	O
the	O
process	O
and	O
I	O
believe	O
it	O
is	O
almost	O
like	O
a	O
slow-acting	O
poison.	O


Didn't	O
associate	O
my	O

with	O
Lipitor	B-Drug

I've	O

Have	O
had	O

with	O
my	O
hips	O

knees	O
in	O
the	O
past	O
but	O
just	O
within	O
the	O
last	O

I've	O
been	O
experiencing	O
spasms	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
upper	I-ADR

especially	O
after	O
doing	O
anything	O
physical.	O


Now	O
I	O
have	O
a	O
dr.	O


apptmt.	O


in	O
a	O
few	O
days	O
because	O
my	O
right	B-ADR
knee	I-ADR
is	I-ADR
so	I-ADR
painful	I-ADR
I	O
can't	O
even	O
bend	O
it!	O
It	O
hurts	B-ADR
to	I-ADR
get	B-ADR
up	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
morning,	I-ADR
get	B-ADR
out	I-ADR
of	I-ADR
a	I-ADR
chair,	I-ADR
go	B-ADR
up	I-ADR
stairs.	I-ADR


Also,	O
I	O
have	O
had	O
operations	O
on	O
my	O
right	B-ADR
foot	I-ADR
a	O
few	O
years	O
ago,	O
but	O
now	O
it	O
hurts	B-ADR
almost	O
as	O
much	O
if	O
not	O
more.	O


The	O
bottom	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
foot	I-ADR
is	I-ADR
extremely	B-ADR
tender	I-ADR
as	O
are	O
my	O
calves.	B-ADR


The	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
did	O
lower	O
my	O
cholesteral	O
wonderfully;	O
but	O
I'm	O
extremely	O
concerned	O
that	O
this	O
may	O
be	O
what	O
my	O

are	O
coming	O
from.	O


Hopefully,	O

with	O

my	O

suggested	O
that	O

Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
3	O
days,	O
and	O
see	O
if	O
it	O
has	O
any	O

The	O
effect	O
was	O
dramatic.	O


The	O
cramps	B-ADR
did	O
not	O
occur	O
during	O
the	O
night	O
after	O
I	O
did	O
not	O
take	O

also	O
did	O

did	O
not	O
want	O
to	O
restart	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
(once	O
a	O

for	O
fear	O
that	O
the	O
cramps	B-ADR
would	O
just	O
as	O
quickly	O
return.	O


Since	O
it	O
was	O
possible	O
that	O
the	O
reason	O
why	O
the	O
night	O
cramps	B-ADR
ceased	O
so	O
quickly	O
is	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
taking	O
the	O
40	O

entirely	O
in	O
the	O

I	O

that	B-ADR

age.	O


Severe	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
both	I-ADR
calfs	B-ADR

I	O
became	O

my	I-ADR

my	I-ADR

or	O
even	O
get	B-ADR
in	I-ADR

This	O
developed	O
after	O
being	O
on	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
about	O
5	O
years.	O


I	O
was	O
on	O
10	O
mg	O
and	O
complained	O
about	O
discomfort	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
legs	I-ADR
but	O
my	O
cardiologist	O
just	O
said	O
it	O
was	O
old	O
age	O
and	O
even	O
upped	O
my	O
dose	O
to	O
20	O
mg.	O


That	O
really	O
made	O
things	O
a	O
lot	O
worst	O
and	O
now	O
I	O
just	O
stopped	O
it	O
and	O
within	O
24	O
hours	O
could	O
see	O
an	O
improvement.	O


Incidently	O
I	O
am	O
a	O
physician	O
and	O
was	O
aware	O
of	O
the	O
myalgia	B-ADR
with	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
but	O
I	O
suspect	O
it	O
is	O
much	O
worst	O
than	O
the	O
drug	O
company	O
would	O
have	O
you	O
believe.	O


This	O
is	O
really	O
a	O
very	O
toxic	O
drug	O
and	O
should	O
be	O
used	O
with	O
caution.	O


This	O
is	O
a	O
drug	O
which	O
is	O
very	O
effective	O
in	O
lowering	O
cholesterol	O
but	O
also	O
affects	O
many	O
metabolic	O
pathways	O
in	O
the	O
body	O
and	O
is	O
potentially	O
dangerous.	O


Over	O

that	O
until	O
I	O

when	O
I	O
complained	O
that	O

Everything	O

I	O
will	O

because	O
some	O
people	O

fine	O
on	O
it	O

I	O
wish	O
my	O

had	O

the	O

that	O
it	O
was	O

The	O
only	O
side	O
effect	O
they	O
asked	O
about	O
was	O
muscle	B-ADR

which	O
I	O
didn't	O

and	O
I	O

anything	O

I	O

I	O
told	O

about	O
my	O

and	O
was	O
told	O
that	O
I	O

it.	O


I	O
left	O

the	O

my	I-ADR

began	O
to	O
go	O
away.	O


After	O
2	O

I	O
knew	O
it	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
dangerous	O
medication.	O


I	O
went	O
to	O
my	O

he	O
wanted	O
me	O
to	O
try	O

I	O

I	O

I	O

you	O
listen	O

I	O
now	O
tell	O

what	O
their	O

them.	O

the	O

you	O

while	O

that	O

After	O
using	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
2.5	O
years,	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
stop	O
two	O
weeks	O
ago	O
because	O
of	O
severe	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
left	I-ADR

I	O
am	O
left	O

and	O
recently	O
couldn't	O
normally	O
do	O
my	O

Twice	O
I	O
told	O
my	O
doctor	O
about	O
pain	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
arm	I-ADR
and	O
he	O
didn't	O
take	O
that	O
seriously,	O
ignoring	O
my	O
complaint.	O


After	O
two	O
weeks	O
of	O
not	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
my	O
arm	O
almost	O
recovered	O
and	O
I	O
can	O
work	O
without	O
any	O
pain	B-ADR
or	O
any	O
problem.	O


It	O
started	O
a	O
long	O
time	O
ago	O
with	O
tingling	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
arms,	I-ADR
they	O
were	O
often	O
fall	O
asleep,	O
usually	O
when	O
I	O
wake	O
up	O
in	O
the	O

From	O
month	O
to	O
month	O
pain	B-ADR
was	O
worst	O
until	O
I	O
almost	O
lost	B-ADR
all	I-ADR
strength	I-ADR
and	O
couldn't	B-ADR
use	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
arm.	I-ADR


Anyway,	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
good	O
decision	O
by	O
not	O
using	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
anymore	O
(my	O
doctor	O
will	O
be	O
mad	O
at	O
me).	O


I	O
will	O

A	O

I	O
began	O

have	O
a	O

in	I-ADR
the	I-ADR

of	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

diagnosed	O
as	O
a	O

(It	O
seemed	O

to	O

Then	O
the	O
left	B-ADR

started	I-ADR

I	O
nearly	O
stopped	O
walking	O
for	O
6	O
months,	O
hoping	O
to	O
get	O
better	O
to	O
avoid	O

I	O
stopped	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
as	O
an	O
experiment,	O
and	O
after	O
3	O
days	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
changed	O
completely.	O


It	O
began	O
to	O
heal	O
after	O
that.	O


Every	O

has	O

a	O

I	O
experienced	O

while	O
taking	O
this	O

Lipitor	B-Drug

a	O

all	O

I	O

Luckily	O
most	O

there	O
was	O
a	O

and	O
my	O

I	O

About	O
2	O
months	O
ago	O
while	O
I	O
first	O
told	O
my	O
doctor	O
I	O
lost	B-ADR
some	I-ADR
body	I-ADR
balance	I-ADR
and	O
it	O
might	O
be	O
due	O
to	O
lipitor	B-Drug
buy	O
my	O
doctor	O
told	O
me	O
the	O
side	O
effect	O
was	O
most	O
likely	O
by	O
some	O
other	O
reason(s).	O


During	O
my	O
second	O
visiting	O
him,	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
my	O
blood	O
test	O
CK	O
is	O
90	O
and	O
my	O
muscle	O
should	O
be	O
OK.	O


Then	O
I	O
continued	O
to	O
take	O
10	O
mg	O
lipitor,	B-Drug
but	O
I	O
felt	O
more	O
on	O
muscle	B-ADR
and	O
joint	B-ADR
pain	B-ADR
and	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
feel	O
I	O
lost	B-ADR
some	I-ADR
memory.	I-ADR


Therefore,	O
I	O
deeply	O
believed	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
side	O
effects	O
by	O
taking	O
lipitor.	B-Drug


After	O
about	O
a	O
week	O
to	O
10	O
day	O
without	O
lipitor,	B-Drug
I	O
got	O
my	O
memory	O
back	O
to	O
nomal	O
level	O
and	O
my	O
body	O
balance	O
is	O
getting	O
better.	O


During	O
my	O
third	O
doctor	O
visit,	O
my	O
doctor	O
finally	O
believed	O
that	O
I	O
got	O
bad	O
side	O
effects	O
and	O
he	O
told	O
me	O
it	O
would	O
take	O
months	O
for	O
recovery.	O


Now	O
my	O
doctor	O
wants	O
me	O
to	O
take	O
B3	B-Drug
or	O
Niaspan	B-Drug
instead	O
of	O
lipitor.	B-Drug

Upon	O

if	O

I'll	O
stop	O
before	O
the	O
two	O

What	O
I	O
am	O
reading	O
is	O
that	O
most	O
doctors	O
are	O
NOT	O
prescribing	O
conservative	O
dosages	O
-	O
maybe	O
take	O
that	O
back	O

the	O

Eh?	O
My	O

too	O

So	O
I	O
am	O
here	O
looking	O
for	O

anecdotally	O

12	O
weeks	O

Lipitor.	B-Drug


I	O
reported	O
to	O
my	O
cardiologist	O
and	O
internist	O
who	O
both	O
denied	O
problems	O
were	O
related	O
to	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
because	O
my	O
CPK	B-ADR
was	O
only	O
mildly	B-ADR
elevated	I-ADR
(250).	O


I	O
also	O
saw	O
a	O
podiatrist,	O
chiropractor,	O
and	O
spine	O
specialist	O
with	O
no	O
relief.	O


When	O
it	O
got	O
so	O

I	O
could	O
not	O
take	O
it	O
anymore	O
and	O
did	O
not	O
care	O
about	O
my	O

I	O
took	O
myself	O
off	O
of	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
got	O
a	O
50%	O
improvement	O
after	O
one	O
week.	O


I	O
then	O
saw	O
a	O
neurologist	O
who	O
diagnosed	O
me	O
with	O
statin	B-Disease
induced	I-Disease
myalgia.	I-Disease


He	O
said	O
he	O

a	O

that	O

My	O

When	O
the	O

for	O
the	O
last	O
18	O
months	O
I've	O
been	O
having	O
problems	B-ADR
with	I-ADR
various	I-ADR
muscles.	I-ADR


Started	O
with	O
my	O
SI	O
joints.	O


lots	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
in	I-ADR
the	I-ADR
muscles	B-ADR
there,	O
very	B-ADR
tight.	I-ADR


Then	O
my	O
neck	B-ADR
started	O
getting	O
stiff	B-ADR
and	O
the	O
muscles	B-ADR
are	I-ADR
like	I-ADR
boards	I-ADR
they're	I-ADR
so	I-ADR
tight.	I-ADR


Now	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
has	I-ADR
gone	I-ADR
into	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
shoulder	B-ADR
and	O
upper	B-ADR
arm	I-ADR
on	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
left	I-ADR

Just	O
last	O
week	O
I	O
noticed	O
my	O
right	B-ADR
arm	I-ADR
is	I-ADR
tight	I-ADR
also.	O


I	O
can't	B-ADR
sleep	I-ADR
on	I-ADR

now.	O


My	O
lower	B-ADR
back	I-ADR
is	I-ADR
also	I-ADR

again!	O
And	O
I	O
get	O
terrible	B-ADR
headaches	I-ADR
from	O
the	O
tight	B-ADR
neck	I-ADR
muscles.	I-ADR


I	O
googled	O
muscle	B-Finding

and	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
showed	O
up	O
on	O
the	O
first	O
6	O
or	O
7	O
entries!!	O
I	O
read	O
all	O
the	O
comments	O
on	O
this	O

and	O
couldn't	O
believe	O
it!!	O
I	O
see	O
my	O
symptoms	O
over	O
and	O
over!	O
So,	O
I	O
had	O
blood	O
tests	O
done	O
this	O
week	O
and	O
have	O
elevated	B-ADR
creatine	I-ADR
so	O
was	O
told	O
today	O
to	O
stop	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
immediately,	O
and	O
will	O
see	O
my	O
doctor	O
next	O

After	O

all	O

I	O
have	O
no	O

that	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
is	O
the	O
cause	O
of	O
all	O
this	O

I	O
just	O
hope	O
and	O
pray	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
recover	O
from	O
these	O

I	O
will	O
use	O

other	O

to	O
help	O
my	O

but	O
if	O
that	O
doesn't	O

hey.	O


I'd	O
rather	O
die	O

a	O

so	O
bad	O
that	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
stop	O
working.	O


Recently	O
I	O
was	O
diagnosed	O
with	O
kidney	B-ADR
failure	I-ADR
and	O
also	O
put	O
on	O
zetia.	B-Drug


I	O
immediately	O
started	O
to	O
feel	O
even	O
worse,	O
but	O
took	O
the	O
drug	O
for	O
a	O
year	O
until	O
my	O
symptoms	O
got	O
to	O
be	O
unbearable.	O


My	O
doctor	O
dismissed	O
the	O
leg	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
and	O
said	O
that	O
kidney	B-ADR
failure	I-ADR
was	O
unrelated.	O


Do	O
not	O
take	O
statins!	O
They	O
will	O
rob	O
you	O
of	O
your	O

The	O

you	O
that	O
you'll	O
live	O

avoid	O
heart	B-Finding
attacks	I-Finding
by	O
taking	O
this.	O


Read	O
the	O

I	O
stopped	O
all	O

Leg	B-ADR

My	O

I'll	O

from	O
the	O

will	O
need	O

Will	O
explore	O

Very	O
slowly,	O
over	O

I	O

I	O
immediately	O
went	O

Thank	O

I	O
read	O
that	O

there	O

I	O

to	O

my	O

I	O

my	O

he	O
sent	O
me	O
to	O
an	O
arthritis	B-Finding
specialist,	O
I	O
had	O
x-rays.	O


nothing	O
was	O
found.	O


I	O
felt	B-ADR
like	I-ADR
an	I-ADR
old	I-ADR
(older)	I-ADR
man	I-ADR
during	O
this	O
period,	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O

my	O

the	O
things	O
I	O
enjoy	O

My	O
prescription	O
of	O
lipitor	B-Drug
ran	O
out	O
a	O
few	O
months	O
after	O
these	O
tests	O
were	O
done.	O


I	O
didn't	O
bother	O
refilling	O
it	O
right	O
away	O
and	O
noticed	O
my	O
knees	O

felt	O
better.	O


I	O
renewed	O
the	O

and	O
no	O

had	O
I	O
started	O
taking	O
it	O
again	O
that	O
I	O
felt	O
the	O

So	O
I	O

the	O

After	O

this	O

right	O
away	O
he	O
says	O
oh	O

that's	O
probably	O
right	O
Pardon!?	O
So	O
why	O
didn't	O
you	O
mention	O
that	O
possibility	O
before	O
all	O
the	O

(luckily	O
since	O

these	O

I	O

it.	O


About	O
two	O
years	O

I	O

that	O

About	O
a	O
year	O

my	O

would	I-ADR

at	O
times	O
when	O
I	O
rested	O
my	O

on	O
a	O

This	O
would	O

I	O
also	O
began	O
having	O

while	I-ADR

would	O

Two	O
months	O
ago	O
my	O

became	I-ADR
painful	I-ADR
for	O
no	O
reason.	O


The	O
more	O
I	O
walked	O
on	O
it	O
the	O
worse	O
it	O
felt.	O


I	O
switched	O
shoes	O
with	O
no	O

It	O
hurt	O
enough	O
that	O
I	O
began	O
to	O
worry	O
I	O
might	O
end	O
up	O
on	O
disability	O
if	O
it	O
got	O
much	O
worse.	O


I	O
was	O
recently	O
out	O
of	O
state	O
for	O
two	O
weeks	O
and	O
still	O
had	O
congestion	B-ADR
in	O
spite	O
of	O
being	O
in	O
a	O
totally	O
different	O
environment.	O


That	O
was	O
when	O
I	O
suspected	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
did	O
some	O
research	O
on	O
line	O
and	O
saw	O
matches	O
with	O
all	O
of	O
my	O
symptoms.	O


I	O
immediately	O
stopped	O
it	O
and	O
the	O
next	O
morning	O
the	O
congestion	B-ADR
was	O
80%	O
less.	O


I	O
saw	O
my	O
doctor	O
who	O
agreed	O
I	O
need	O
to	O
stop	O
it.	O


He	O
explained	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
side	O
affects	O
and	O
there	O
is	O
no	O
way	O
to	O
predict	O
who	O
will	O
get	O
which	O
ones	O
or	O
when	O
they	O
will	O
develop.	O


The	O
blood	O
tests	O
give	O
a	O
false	O
sense	O

since	O
the	O
results	O
(like	O
mine)	O
can	O
be	O

yet	O
other	O

This	O

only	O
gratefull	O
to	O
the	O

for	O

what	O
can	O

it	O

to	O
everybody	O

Initially	O
there	O
were	O
no	O
side	O

It	O
took	O
the	O
better	O
part	O
of	O
two	O
years	O
for	O
them	O
to	O
start	O
appearing.	O


During	O
that	O
time,	O
my	O
numbers	O
were	O
doing	O
great!	O
But	O
then,	O
very	O
gradually,	O
things	O
began	O
to	O
change.	O


Fatigue	B-ADR
was	O
the	O
first	O

for	O
me.	O


It	O
hit	O
hard!	O
I	O
was	O
retireing	O
at	O
9PM	O
when	O
it	O
used	O
to	O
be	O
11:30.	O


Then	O
the	O
muscle	B-ADR
and	O
joint	B-ADR
pain	B-ADR
kicked	O
in.	O


I	O
felt	B-ADR
much	I-ADR
older	I-ADR
than	I-ADR
I	I-ADR
was.	I-ADR


My	O
family	O
noticed	O
the	O
short	B-ADR

before	O
I	O
did.	O


It	O
was	O
very	O

for	O
me.	O


The	O
blisterey	B-ADR
rash	I-ADR
on	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
arms	B-ADR
and	O
legs	B-ADR
had	O
me	O
concerned	O
even	O
more.	O


What	O
was	O
wrong	O
with	O
me?	O
Is	O
this	O
what	O

bring?	O
When	O
my	O

I	O

That	O
was	O
in	O

By	O

07,	O
I	O
was	O
off	O
Lipitor	B-Drug

My	O

tried	O
various	O

without	O

until	O
we	O
got	O
to	O
Simivastatin	B-Drug

I	O
took	O

for	O
approximately	O

then	O
started	O

the	O

I	O
discontinued	O

That	O
was	O
about	O
a	O

I	O
am	O

I	O

I	O
had	O

that	O

to	O

It	O
took	O

LEt	O
me	O
be	O
the	O
first	O
to	O

that	O
I	O

I	O

I	O
have	O

take	O

that	O
exfoliate	O
my	O

so	O
probably	O
a	O
whopping	O
dose	O
is	O
going	O
in.	O


I	O
have	O
found	O
that	O
I	O
can	O
use	O
a	O
q-tip	O
and	O
just	O
put	O
it	O
on	O
a	O
few	O
spots	O
and	O
then	O
do	O
not	O
get	O
the	O

so	O
I	O
may	O
do	O
it	O
this	O

just	O
treat	O
one	O

When	O

with	O
a	O

I	O
had	O
some	O

it	O

the	O

I	O
went	O
a	O

I	O

now,	O
I	O
am	O
fairly	O
certain	O
it	O
was	O
the	O
Voltaren.	B-Drug


I	O
must	O
say	O
that	O
my	O

did	O
improve	O
within	O
3	O
days	O
but	O
the	O
ER	O
visit	O
was.	O

I	O
was	O
on	O

about	O

had	O

that	I-ADR

I	O
had	O
every	O

they	O
couldnt	O
find	O
anything.	O


I	O
was	O
completley	O
healthy!	O
I	O
am	O
thinking	O
it	O
was	O
from	O
the	O

I	O
have	O

off	O

the	O

I	O
started	O

out	O

that	O
has	O

alot.	O


I	O

I	O
will	O

Despite	O

I	O
think	O
it	O
is	O
worth	O
to	O
try	O
this	O
for	O
the	O

Of	O

I	O

I	O

I	O
feel	O

a	O
25	O

It	O
also	O

all	O
my	O

I	O

I	O
took	O
one	O

15	O

I	O
hate	O
when	O
Pharmecitical	O

these	O
and	O
have	O
DR's	O
advertise	O
and	O
experiment	O
on	O

only	O
took	O

that	O
Voltaren	B-Drug
took	O
away	O
all	O
my	O

i	O
rarely	O
use	O

helps	O
or	O
takes	O
too	O
long	O
to	O
take	O
affect	O
and	O
just	O
"soldier	O

As	O
i	O

.	O


.	O


it's	O
taken	O

almost	O
a	O
week	O
to	O
realize	O
this	O
bleeding	O
is	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
medication.	O


The	O
bleeding	O
started	O
almost	O
immediately	O
after	O
taking	O
the	O
first	O
dose.	O


I	O
initially	O
thought	O
I	O
was	O
having	O
my	O
period	O
(even	O
though	O
it	O
was	O

If	O
anyone	O

regarding	O
how	O
long	O
this	O

I	O
would	O
appreciate	O
it.	O


It	O
only	O
took	O
three	O
pills	O
only	O
one	O
a	O
day	O
to	O
realize	O
that	O
the	O
side	O
effects	O
can	O
be	O
quite	O
dangerous.	O


On	O
the	O
first	O
night	O
my	O
heart	B-ADR
was	I-ADR
thumping	I-ADR
pretty	O
hard	O
all	O

and	O
weird	O

On	O

the	O

nausea	B-ADR

The	O

quit	O
after	O
4rth	O
night.	O


Volteren	B-Drug
did	O
nothing	O
to	O
help	O
my	O

Even	O
with	O
a	O
full	O
stomach,	O
this	O
pill	O
can	O
be	O
very	O
hard	O
to	O
handle.	O


Side	O
effects	O
can	O
easily	O
bring	O
you	O
closer	O
to	O
the	O
grave.	O


On	O
day	O
8,	O
starting	O
wheezing	B-ADR
at	O
night.	O


During	O
the	O
next	O
3	O
days	O
the	O
wheezing	O
became	O
a	O
24/7	O
side	O
effect,	O
with	O
it	O
being	O
so	O
bad	O
at	O
night,	O
I	O
couldn't	O
sleep	O
for	O
more	O
than	O
45	O
minutes.	O


The	O
wheezing	O
literally	O
woke	O
me	O
up,	O
it	O
was	O
so	O
loud.	O


I	O
also	O
got	O
a	O

Doc	O

an	O

I	O
have	O
a	O

a	O
degenerative	B-Disease

This	O
medicine	O
has	O
been	O
extrememly	O
helpful.	O


I	O
don't	O
take	O
it	O
daily,	O
but	O
at	O
the	O
first	O
sign	O
of	O
a	O
flare	O
and	O
it	O
helps	O
almost	O
immediately.	O


I	O
tried	O
Relafen,	B-Drug
vicodine,	B-Drug
flexeril	B-Drug
and	O
OTC	O
pain	O

and	O
nothing	O
has	O
helped	O
like	O
this.	O


Lots	O
of	O
stomach	O
gurgling	O
after	O
eating,	O
which	O
has	O
been	O
consistent	O
even	O
after	O
adjusting	O
to	O
the	O
medication,	O
and	O
initial	O
doses	O
gave	O
diarrhea	B-ADR
for	O
a	O
few	O
days.	O


I	O
have	O
switched	O
to	O
taking	O
it	O
with	O
a	O
snack	O
before	O
bedtime	O
with	O
good	O
results.	O


For	O
me,	O
it	O
has	O
been	O
very	O
effective	O
pain	O
relief	O
for	O
my	O
chronic	B-Symptom
bone/joint	I-Symptom
pain	I-Symptom
from	O
a	O

after	O
one	O

Towards	O

began	O
getting	O
tightness	B-ADR
in	I-ADR
my	I-ADR

These	O

worsened	O
over	O

the	O

by	O
diarrhea,	B-ADR
lots	O
of	O
it!	O
Also,	O
LOTS	O
of	O
gas,	B-ADR
gurgling,	B-ADR
mild	B-ADR
cramping	I-ADR
all	O
day.	O


I	O
tried	O
one	O
more	O
today,	O
immediately	O
got	O
a	O
bad	B-ADR
headache,	I-ADR
and	O
cramping,	B-ADR
nausea,	B-ADR
and	O
heartburn.	B-ADR


That	O
does	O
it.	O


I'm	O
going	O
back	O
to	O
iubrofen!.	B-Drug


I	O
took	O
this	O
the	O
first	O
time	O
in	O
February	O
2008,	O
and	O
have	O
taken	O
it	O
occasionally	O
since.	O


Basically	O
it	O
works	O
great	O
for	O
my	O
pain,	B-Symptom
but	O
I	O
can't	O
live	O
with	O
the	O
side	O
effects.	O


Extreme	O
diarrhea,	B-ADR
vomiting,	B-ADR
extreme	B-ADR
sweating,	I-ADR
dizzyness,	B-ADR
very	B-ADR
weak,	I-ADR
powerful	O
chills	B-ADR
but	O
no	O
fever,	O
bloody	O
discharge.	O


Very	O
bad	O
reaction	O
by	O
my	O
body.	O


This	O
drug	O
MAY	O
have	O
caused	O
edema	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
fingers	I-ADR
and	I-ADR
face	I-ADR
after	O
taking	O
for	O
4	O
days.	O


Also	O
may	O
have	O
caused	O
shortness	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
breath.	I-ADR


Also	O
some	O
crabbiness	B-ADR
and	O
cramping	B-ADR
(as	O
in	O
menstrual)	O
and	O
spotting.	B-ADR


Timing	B-ADR
off	I-ADR
for	I-ADR
a	I-ADR
true	I-ADR
period,	I-ADR
so	O
suspect	O
Voltaren	B-Drug
is	O
the	O
culprit.	O


Took	O
one	O
50	O
mg	O
pill	O
each	O
day	O
for	O
5	O
days.	O


The	O
first	O
day	O
it	O
seemed	O
to	O
make	O
all	O
the	O
pain	O
of	O
a	O
muscle	B-Symptom
spasm	I-Symptom
in	O
shoulder	O
go	O
away.	O


It	O
almost	O
seemed	O
like	O
a	O
miracle.	O


The	O
effects	O
diminished	O
each	O
day	O
(I	O
have	O
pain	O
almost	O
all	O
the	O
time)	O
and	O
now	O
my	O
face	B-ADR
and	I-ADR
fingers	I-ADR
are	I-ADR
swollen	I-ADR
and	O
I	O
am	O
short	B-ADR
of	I-ADR
breath,	I-ADR
cramping	B-ADR
and	O
bloated.	B-ADR


Interesting	O
to	O
see	O
females	O
posting	O
similar	O
troubles.	O


I	O
will	O
NEVER	O
take	O
another	O
one	O
of	O
these.	O


No	O
side	O
effects	O
at	O
all	O
in	O
first	O
24	O
hours.	O


First	O
day.	O


Immediate	O
and	O
absolute	O
relief.	O


I	O
don't	O
get	O
immediate	O
and	O
lasting	O
relief	O
from	O
panadeine	B-Drug
or	O
Ibuprofen	B-Drug
plus.	I-Drug


Codeine	B-Drug
medications	O
aren't	O
as	O
effective	O
and	O
upset	B-ADR
my	I-ADR
stomach	I-ADR
on	O
occasions.	O


So	O
far	O
this	O
voltaren	B-Drug
rapid	I-Drug
25	I-Drug
hasn't.	O


First	O
time	O
in	O
years	O
my	O
back	B-Symptom
ache	I-Symptom
has	O
gone	O
away	O
so	O
effectively.	O


Really	O
hope	O
it	O
last	O
and	O
i	O
can	O
wake	O
up	O
still	O
feeling	O
completely	O
pain	B-Symptom
free.	O


I	O
had	O
no	O
side	O
effects	O
the	O
first	O
two	O
days.	O


The	O
doctor	O
prescribed	O
for	O
me	O
to	O
take	O
2	O
per	O
day	O
and	O
I'm	O
very	O
glad	O
I	O
didn't.	O


I	O
took	O
one	O
per	O
day	O
and	O
this	O
is	O
the	O
third	O
day.	O


My	O
face	B-ADR
has	I-ADR
felt	I-ADR
numb	I-ADR
most	O
of	O
the	O
day	O
and	O
I	O
feel	O
light	B-ADR
headed.	I-ADR


I've	O
had	O
to	O
get	O
up	O
and	O
walk	O
this	O
feeling	O
off,	O
which	O
has	O
not	O
been	O
fun	O
on	O
the	O
knee.	O


I	O
wouldn't	O
suggest	O
voltaren	B-Drug
because	O
it	O
did	O
nothing	O
for	O
the	O
inflammation	B-Symptom
in	O
the	O
knee	O
and	O
has	O
me	O
in	O
a	O
panic	O
until	O
I	O
can	O
get	O
this	O
stuff	O
out	O
of	O
my	O
system.	O


Possibly	O
diarrhea	B-ADR
and	O
stomach	B-ADR
pain,	I-ADR
but	O
most	O
likely	O
none	O
because	O
I	O
am	O
taking	O
this	O
with	O
a	O
nasty	O
antibiotic	B-Drug
for	O
a	O
sinus	B-Disease
infection	I-Disease
that	O
definitely	O
causes	O
diarrhea	B-ADR
and	O
nausea.	B-ADR


I	O
was	O
supposed	O
to	O
take	O
it	O
2x/day	O
for	O
7	O
days	O
and	O
then	O
2x/day	O
as	O
needed.	O


I	O
completed	O
the	O
7	O
days	O
and	O
then	O
did	O
not	O
take	O
it	O
on	O
the	O
8th	O
day.	O


The	O
pain	B-Symptom
was	O
immediately	O
worse	O
than	O
before	O
taking	O
Voltaren.	B-Drug


It	O
does	O
help	O
the	O
pain	B-Symptom
in	I-Symptom
my	I-Symptom
knee,	I-Symptom
which	O
is	O
a	O
strained	B-Disease
meniscus,	I-Disease
but	O
I'm	O
afraid	O
that	O
the	O
drug	O
is	O
masking	O
the	O
pain	B-Symptom
which	O
enables	O
me	O
to	O
overexert	O
my	O
joints	O
and	O
cause	O
more	O
injury.	O


This	O
really	O
makes	O
me	O
nervous.	O


I	O
am	O
going	O
to	O
speak	O
with	O
my	O
doctor	O
about	O
this	O
possibility.	O


Horrific	O
medication	O
-	O
Suffered	O
an	O
acute	B-ADR
pancreatic	I-ADR
attack	I-ADR
with	O
critical	B-ADR
blood	I-ADR

that	O
almost	O
caused	O
my	O
death.	O


My	O
entire	O
body	B-ADR
was	I-ADR
"shutting"	I-ADR
down.	I-ADR


My	O
blood	O
reports	O
were	O
at	O
critical	O
levels,	O
BP	B-ADR
was	I-ADR
very	I-ADR
low	I-ADR
98/60,	O

Then	O
the	O
doctor	O
in	O
charge	O
left	O
us	O
floundering	O
on	O
our	O
own,	O
going	O
from	O
one	O
specialist	O
after	O
another	O
to	O
counter	O
what	O
was	O
happening.	O


My	O
children	O
did	O
some	O
research	O
on	O
the	O
web	O
about	O
my	O
drugs	O
that	O
I	O
was	O
taking,	O
which	O
included	O
Voltaren,and	B-Drug
learned	O
about	O
the	O
adverse	O
reactions	O
to	O
this	O
drug	O
and	O
I	O
stopped	O
Voltaren.	B-Drug


The	O
specialists	O
agreed	O
with	O
this	O
conclusion,	O
since	O
they	O
were	O
exact	O
to	O
my	O
problems.	O


My	O
body	O
reacted	O
and	O
I	O
recovered	O
gradually.	O


My	O
advice	O
to	O
all	O
-	O
STOP	O
-	O
Find	O
something	O
else.	O


I	O
lost	O
2	O
months	O
of	O
my	O
life	O
and	O
I	O
still	O
don't	O
remember	B-ADR
the	I-ADR
entire	I-ADR
e.	I-ADR


If	O
you	O
are	O
taking	O
this	O
drug	O
-	O
Make	O
absolutely	O
sure	O
that	O
you	O
get	O
blood	O
work	O
done	O
every	O
6	O
months,	O
in	O
order	O
to	O
catch	O
any	O
critical	O
levels	O
in	O
your	O
blood.	O


Then	O
-	O
STOP	O
-	O
the	O
drug.	O


Mild	O
sedation.	B-ADR


This	O
is	O
a	O
GREAT	O
drug	O
for	O
me.	O


I	O
am	O
usually	O
VERY	O
affected	O
negatively	O
with	O
most	O
meds.	O


Voltaren	B-Drug
totally	O
relieves	O
my	O
pain	B-Symptom
when	O
nothing	O
else	O
worked.	O


I	O
take	O
it	O
with	O
a	O

so	O
I	O

Haven't	O

experienced	O
any	O

thankfully.	O


This	O
medicine	O
seems	O
to	O
work	O
very	O
well.	O


My	O
throat	B-ADR
still	O
hurts	B-ADR
while	O
on	O
it;	O
however	O
the	O

is	O

and	O
I	O
am	O
able	O
to	O
function	O
through	O
the	O
day	O
until	O
my	O

works	O
its	O
course	O

not	O
recommended.	O


Gave	O
pretty	O
good	O
pain	B-Symptom
relief,	O
with	O
no	O
side	O
effects,	O
and	O
is	O
very	O
fast	O
acting.	O


Better	O
than	O
mobic.	B-Drug


I	O
was	O
prescribed	O
Zipsor	B-Drug
for	O
bone	B-Symptom
and	O
joint	B-Symptom
pain	B-Symptom
associated	O
with	O
Lupus.	B-Disease


I	O
also	O
have	O
3	O

that	O
have	O
been	O

me	O
for	O
years,	O

for	O
which	O
I	O
have	O
always	O
taken	O
a	O
low	O
dose	O
of	O
Vicodin	B-Drug
(almost	O
daily).	O


The	O
Zipsor	B-Drug
works	O
well	O
on	O
the	O
Lupus	B-Symptom
pain,	I-Symptom
but	O
also	O
almost	O
completely	O
wiped	O
out	O
the	O
pain	B-Symptom
from	I-Symptom
the	I-Symptom
herniated	I-Symptom
discs,	I-Symptom
and	O
has	O
replaced	O
my	O

for	O
my	O

As	O
with	O
any	O

when	O
they	O
do	O
occur	O
now	O
they	O
are	O
minor,	O
and	O
once	O
I	O
take	O
my	O
usual	O
dose	O
of	O
Zipsor,	B-Drug
the	O
pain	B-Symptom
is	O

again.	O


I	O
