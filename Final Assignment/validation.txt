tell	O
my	O
Dr	O
I	O
was	O
having	O
muscle	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR

leg	B-ADR

The	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
was	O
great	O
at	O

my	O

improving	O
the	O
ratio	O
of	O
my	O

however	O
on	O
the	O

I	O

My	O

This	O
was	O
the	O

I	O
had	O
the	O
reaction	O

I	O
thought	O
perhaps	O
that	O
I	O
was	O

I	O
was	O

I	O
believe	O
that	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
left	O
me	O
with	O
permanent	B-ADR
joint	I-ADR

and	O
would	O
join	O
any	O

Lipitor	B-Drug

The	O

that	O
my	O

I	O
've	O
also	O
had	O
very	O

that	O
any	O

time	O
you	O
go	O
in	O
for	O
a	O

it	O
could	O
be	O

So	O
I	O
decided	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
any	O

take	O
some	O
Q10	B-Drug
to	O
build	O

Therefore	O
I	O
