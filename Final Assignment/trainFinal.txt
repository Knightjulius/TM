the	O

my	O
reason	O
for	O

was	O
because	O

to	O

you	O

that	O
no	O

Thank	O
you	O

for	O

write	O
so	O
we	O
aren	O
't	O
prisoners	O
to	O
just	O
our	O
doctor	O
's	O
advice!	O

This	O
drug	O
should	O
have	O
a	O
pre-qualifier	O
before	O
perscribed	O
or	O
better	O
yet	O

Basically	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
has	O
ruined	O
my	O
formerly	O
active	O
life	O

Lipitor	B-Drug
did	O
the	O
job	O
on	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
both	O
LDL	O
and	O
HDL	O

It	O
did	O
lower	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
tho	O

I	O
took	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
for	O
7	O
years	O
due	O
a	O
genetic	O
form	O
of	O
high	O
cholesterol	O

Stopped	O
taking	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
in	O
April	O
2006	O
and	O
rapidly	O
improved	O
but	O
a	O
month	O
later	O
started	O
going	O
downhill	O
again	O
and	O
have	O
now	O
been	O
diagnosed	O
with	O
ALS	B-ADR

It	O
was	O
very	O
embarrasing	O
for	O
me	O

I	O
cut	O
the	O
dose	O
from	O
10mg	O
to	O
5mg	O
and	O
reduced	O
above	O
side	O
effects	O
by	O
about	O
40%	O

The	O
result	O
of	O
taking	O
this	O
drug	O
has	O
seriously	O
impaired	B-ADR
my	I-ADR
ability	I-ADR
to	I-ADR
take	B-ADR
long	I-ADR
walks	I-ADR
or	O
exercise	B-ADR
in	O
general	O
since	O
to	O
do	O
so	O
causes	O
the	O
leg	B-ADR
muscle	I-ADR
pain	I-ADR
to	O
flair	O
up	O

It	O
lowered	O
my	O

to	O
be	O
sure	O

don	O
't	O
know	O
what	O
to	O
do	O
to	O
find	O
out	O
O

Better	O
a	O
heart	B-Finding
attack	I-Finding
than	O
suicide	O

Then	O
I	O
continued	O
to	O
take	O
10	O
mg	O
lipitor	B-Drug
but	O
I	O
felt	O
more	O
on	O
muscle	B-ADR
and	O
joint	B-ADR
pain	B-ADR
and	O
I	O
started	O
to	O
feel	O
I	O
lost	B-ADR
some	I-ADR
memory	I-ADR

I	O
started	O
taking	O
extra	O
Relefen	B-Drug
and	O
Prednisone	B-Drug
which	O
helped	O
only	O
temporarly	O

Saw	O
an	O
internist	O
and	O
2	O
neurolgists	O
had	O

I	O

this	O
feeling	O
off	O
which	O
has	O
not	O
been	O
fun	O
on	O
the	O

The	O

is	O
toxic	O
and	O
will	O
probably	O
kill	O
you	O
before	O
the	O
high	B-Finding

will	O

My	O
cardiologist	O
started	O
with	O
a	O

I	O

the	O

had	O
the	O
crucial	O

upon	O
my	O

I	O

3	O

The	O
thing	O
is	O
if	O
I	O
were	O
to	O
stop	O
taking	O
zoloft	B-Drug
today	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
months	O
before	O
I	O
felt	O
the	O

returning	O
and	O
it	O
would	O
take	O
months	O
to	O
get	O
back	O
to	O
normal	O
when	O
I	O
restarted	O

Have	O
been	O
to	O
several	O

the	O
two	O

I	O

It	O
was	O
Statin	O

Anyway	O
I	O
think	O
I	O
made	O
a	O
good	O
decision	O
by	O
not	O
using	O
Lipitor	B-Drug
anymore	O
(my	O
doctor	O
will	O
be	O
mad	O
at	O
me)	O

I	O
am	O
scheduled	O
to	O
see	O
another	O

next	O

Thought	O
I	O
would	O
take	O
lipitor	B-Drug
just	O
to	O
be	O
safe	O

Strong	B-ADR
pain	I-ADR
would	O
come	O
and	O
go	O
randomly	O

I	O
note	O
that	O
there	O
are	O
some	O
on	O
this	O
list	O
who	O
have	O
permanent	O
damage	O
so	O
it	O
is	O
serious	O
for	O
some	O
of	O
us	O

some	O
pain	B-Symptom
relief	O

Assuming	O
Liptor	B-Drug
is	O
the	O
culprit	O
I	O
am	O
really	O
annoyed	O
with	O
my	O
doctor	O

Exercised	O
on	O
a	O
regular	O
basis	O
and	O
am	O
in	O
very	O
good	O
shape	O

I	O
HAD	O
THE	O

WITH	O
3	O

and	O

So	O
I	O
went	O
off	O
of	O

and	O
within	O
two	O

I	O
was	O
