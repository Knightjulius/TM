I	O

the	O

This	O

So	O
after	O

that	O

My	O

it	O
will	O
do	O
the	O
trick!	O

Sure	O
it	O
lowered	O
my	O
cholesterol	O
from	O
326	O
to	O
187	O
but	O
it	O
is	O
not	O

The	O

the	O

it	O

there	O
should	O
be	O
a	O

I	O
had	O

with	O
the	O

and	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR

this	O

a	O

to	O

was	O

that	O

I	O
believe	O
it	O

I	O
was	O

with	O
a	O

It	O
took	O
a	O

only	O
although	O
you	O
can	O
replace	O
it	O
every	O
12	O

I	O

it	O

it	O

I	O
consider	O
this	O
to	O
be	O
an	O
extremely	O

drug	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
GREAT	O
drug	O
for	O

It	O
certainly	O

the	O

I	O
will	O
discontinue	O
using	O
lipitor	B-Drug
and	O
see	O
if	O
the	O
pain	B-ADR
goes	O
away	O

I	O
do	O
experience	O
leg	B-ADR
weakness	I-ADR
and	O
cramping	B-ADR

I	O
think	O
some	O
of	O
my	O
symptoms	O
are	O
related	O
to	O
being	O
post	O
menopausal	B-Finding
rather	O
than	O
from	O
the	O
Lipitor	B-Drug

O

Went	O
off	O
the	O

and	O
within	O
2	O

I	O
had	O
severe	O

which	O
cleared	O
after	O
1	O

O
so	O
I	O
paid	O
no	O

it	O

I	O
am	O
hoping	O
this	O
goes	O
away	O
soon	O
and	O
doesn	O
't	O
cause	O
any	O
long	O

Will	O
explore	O

but	O
these	O
drugs	O
have	O
not	O
been	O
around	O
long	O
enough	O
to	O
confirm	O
long	O

effects	O

I	O
went	O
to	O
my	O

and	O
the	O
results	O
of	O
my	O

showed	O
there	O
was	O
something	O
wrong	B-ADR
with	I-ADR
my	I-ADR
liver	I-ADR
and	O
I	O
am	O
a	O

I	O
wish	O
those	O
who	O
take	O
this	O
stuff	O
successfully	O
the	O
best	O
but	O
for	O
those	O
of	O
us	O
who	O
have	O
adverse	O

this	O
can	O
be	O
deviating	O

But	O
are	O
they	O

We	O
are	O
all	O
desperate	O

an	O

(the	O

and	O
ultimately	O
a	O

Somewhat	O
concerned	O
about	O
the	O

and	O
listed	O

so	O
I	O
've	O
only	O
ever	O
taken	O
arthrotec	B-Drug
50	I-Drug
once	O
daily	O
rather	O
than	O
twice	O
which	O
is	O
just	O
enough	O
to	O
manage	O
my	O

was	O

the	O
shingles	B-ADR
resulted	O

the	O

the	O

I	O
had	O

It	O

lower	O
the	O

but	O
I	O
think	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
worth	O

I	O
'd	O
assumed	O
that	O
the	O

that	O

this	O

I	O

a	O

so	O
I	O
felt	O
a	O

better	O
about	O
it	O

None	O
whatsoever	O

I	O
stopped	O

it	O

I	O
think	O
there	O
should	O
be	O
a	O
better	O

such	O
a	O

In	O
November	O
of	O
2005	O

It	O
is	O
a	O
bad	O

you	O

I	O

only	O
one	O
a	O

I	O
'm	O
very	O
curious	O
if	O
these	O

I	O
had	O
been	O
on	O
Pravachol	B-Drug
for	O
aboout	O
3	O

My	O

when	O
I	O

all	O
this	O
wanted	O

because	O
he	O
was	O

about	O
my	O

It	O
was	O
bad	O
enough	O
that	O
I	O
unknowingly	O
ramped	O
up	O
on	O
LIPITOR	B-Drug
and	O
had	O
to	O

I	O
was	O
also	O
as	O
a	O
result	O
cold	O

on	O

I	O
